    "description-en": "Yongfeng hot sauce making technique \"spread\" Yongfeng hot sauce is a traditional condiment or snack with local characteristics. Its production technique is mainly circulated in Yongfeng Town, Shuangfeng County, Hunan Province. In the mid-17th century, the Cai brothers opened three sauce gardens in Yongfeng Town, Cai Guangxiang, Cai Guangyi and Cai Shunyi, and then began to produce hot sauce products on a large scale, forming a reputation effect. In the late Qing Dynasty, Shuangfeng produced about 200 dans of commercial hot sauce annually. During the Republic of China, local sauce drying in Yongfeng was popular and sold in large quantities to Changsha, Shaoyang, Xiangtan and other places. After long-term exploration and practice, Yongfeng people have formed a relatively complete set of sauce-making techniques. Yongfeng spicy sauce is spicy, fresh, salty, sweet and fragrant, rich in nutrition, and has the effects of enhancing appetite, nourishing the spleen and promoting fluid, eliminating stuffiness, dispelling cold. Its production process includes steps such as material selection, ingredients, enzymeization, embryo drying, sauce drying, packaging, etc. When selecting materials, you must choose lantern peppers with fresh meat and thick seeds, wheat, soybeans, glutinous rice, etc. that are specialty around Yongfeng. Selecting ingredients is the first level of Yongfeng hot sauce. Only by selecting good ingredients, controlling the mixing ratio and the operation process of each process can you make high-quality hot sauce. When making, first steam, ferment and grind the wheat, then add salt and mix water, and expose it to the soybean embryo. Then, wash, dry and chop the selected peppers until no pepper seeds are found. Add salt, soybean powder, glutinous rice, etc. and mix them into the soybean embryo and stir evenly. Then, move them to the drying yard to expose it to the sun. The final product has a unique and faint smell of wine, which makes people feel aftertaste. The operation process of each process requires experience to master the softness, hardness, rawness, enzyme degree, drying time, and adjusting the number of stirring times according to different weather temperatures. The traditional products of Yongfeng hot sauce mainly include wheat paste and bean paste. In order to meet the public's requirements for product diversification, more than 20 series of products have been developed in recent years, including seedless hot sauce, garlic hot sauce, beef hot sauce, eight treasure sauce, assorted sauce, beef sauce and high-end selenium-rich sauce, which have been sold all over the country. In the old era, the production skills of Yongfeng hot sauce were taught orally and heartfully, mainly based on family heritage. After the founding of New China, Yongfeng hot sauce gradually shifted from workshop-style production to factory-based production, making the inheritance of masters and apprentices the main inheritance method. Since the 1990s, with the emergence of a number of leading enterprises, Yongfeng's spicy sauce industry has continued to grow and grow, becoming a brand business card of Shuangfeng County and a national geographical indication product in China.

As early as the Jiaqing and Daoguang periods of the Qing Dynasty, streams and stones were quite famous, including inkstones, statues, screens, ornaments and other products. There were nearly 100 shops in Xikou Ancient Town, as well as century-old brands such as \"Yushengtang\" and \"Jiqing Inkstone\". Deng Xianhe of the Qing Dynasty recorded in \"Nancun Caotang Poems\": \"Hu Zhuan'an Mingfu uses the snow-walled stone in Xiangxiang as the inkstone.

It can also be improvised based on the various textures and colors of the stream stones, either carving, engraving or grinding, or slightly carving to take its natural state. The production process of the inkstone is relatively complex and is all made by hand. The production process is divided into steps such as scattering and quarrying, material selection, design, carving, and grinding. In carving, it is important to use art according to the material, to learn skill based on color, and to create natural fortune.

There are dozens of types of Miao people in western Hunan, and the common ones are: flower drum dance, monkey drum dance, women's singles encouragement, men's singles encouragement, and reunion encouragement. The characteristics of these dance moves are: playing and dancing with a bulging rhythm, with a bright rhythm, stretching and generous movements, alternating drums with both hands, jumping in both wheels, and constantly twisting the whole body. \"Monkey Inspiration\" is clever and changeable, witty and humorous, teasing and playing, sometimes playing drums, sometimes leaving drums, and performing coordinatedly. \"Flower Drum Breath\" is gentle and charming, light and soft, and has a gentle body, which is very expressive. \"Men and women's encouragement\" are mostly short stakes with knees bent and dancing, with rugged movements, bold and vigorous movements. \"Women's encouragement\" double caster shuttle, with flexible steps, slightly shaking the head, twisting the waist, implicitly lyrical.

    "description-en": "Vinegar brewing skills (Traditional production skills of Xiangxi balsamic vinegar)\n\n\n\n\nArchaeological discoveries in western Hunan prove that local people mastered the method of making vinegar more than two thousand years ago. People in western Hunan like to eat sour food. The local saying goes, \"Don't eat sour food for a day, don't hike when you go out, don't eat sour food for three days, and stagger when you walk.\" Since ancient times, making vinegar has been a tradition in life, and vinegar is used to make sour food. The Ganzhou Department records that \"Hexi red vinegar began in the fifth year of Jiaqing in the Qing Dynasty (1797)\". The traditional production techniques of Xiangxi balsamic vinegar are typical representatives of the continuous inheritance and development of Cathay Pacific.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional production process of Xiangxi balsamic vinegar:\n\n1. Soak\n\nSelected rice and place it in the bucket with spring water flooded 30-50 cm of rice flour, which is five to seven days. It is better to have a uniform rice grains penetrate the heart and absorb an appropriate amount of water;\n\n\n\n\n2. Drain\n\nSnap the soaked rice and drain it in a bamboo basket, rinse it with clean water until the water is not turbid;\n\n\n\n\n3. Steaming\n\nSteaming is an important process in the mysterious Xiangxi balsamic vinegar production technology, and it is also a necessary prerequisite for inoculation and preparation of koji. The steaming process is divided into three small steps: initial steaming, stewing water, and re-stewing. The initial steaming is generally 20-30 minutes, so that the soaked rice grains can further expand by heat; stewing water causes the rice grains to shrink the surface of the rice grains to break; generally, stewing water can be repeated for ten minutes to expand the rice grains.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Inoculation and music preparation\n\nInoculation and koji production are to make a variety of natural microorganisms grow and reproduce on steamed rice grains, and convert the rice grains into solid vinegar koji. There are three small steps to make vinegar koji. First, use yellow jingle leaves to 20 cm thick and ten cm thick Honeybean grass, lay it on it with a mat of 10 cm thick, then lay a layer of four cm thick ripe rice grains on the mat of 10 cm thick, and finally cover it with the same thick Honeybean grass and yellow jingle leaves, and make solid vinegar chorizo ​​in seven days;\n\n\n\n\n5. Show music\n\nThe sauna is also known as the saunana. The sauna made is exposed to the sun for 1-2 days, evaporating part of the water and eliminating some miscellaneous bacteria;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6. Liquid fermentation\n\nLiquid fermentation is the liquefaction process of liquefaction into the production of vinegar koji. Pour the dried solid vinegar koji into the vinegar jar and add the spring water in a certain proportion. After two years of fermentation, raw vinegar is finally made. During the fermentation process of raw vinegar, it is necessary to manually stir it with wooden sticks twice a day (once in the morning and in the afternoon);\n\n\n\n\n7. Sterilization and purification\n\nSterilization and purification are the last step in the brewing process, which is the processing process of making raw vinegar into finished vinegar. First, filter the raw vinegar and remove impurities through coarse filtering, then add the purified raw vinegar to an appropriate amount of cinnamon, star anise, and rock sugar to put it in a large iron pot and heat it for two hours. Finally, remove the debris and fill it with a bottle and package it to the finished product."

Zhumei Yunhe New Village, Longtang Town, Lianyuan City, Hunan Province is the core distribution area.\n\n \n\nThe story of carrying the Zhumei Mei originated from the ancient custom of \"carrying the Bodhisattva\" in the sacrificial activities. It was part of the fasting and ritual ceremony for villagers to pray for national peace and peace and local peace. It later gradually evolved into \"carrying the story\". Since the Ming Dynasty, in August and September every autumn, hundreds of people gathered together, carrying dozens of \"story\" and traveling to villages to repay the wishes made in spring. Thousands of viewers came from all directions to share this annual rural cultural feast. The \"Bodhisattva\" sacrificial activities in the event must be based on the law for three days. The main agendas include opening the altar to welcome the gods, inviting water, purifying the altar, reciting scriptures, reciting sutras, reciting stories, repaying grace and praying for blessings, traveling on a boat to repent, making wishes, providing relief to orphans, and peace. There are differences between day stories and night stories. The content of Zhumei Pu’s story captures classic plots from folk mythological stories, historical stories, drama stories, and hero stories. The expression forms have developed from the traditional high and low piles to the present, and are more diverse, including stories of tube trucks, swings, boat stories, paper stories, etc. Among them, the high and low piles are one table for each story. The square table is 0.8 meters square as the seat, with red felt on it, and an iron frame with paper and plastic packaging on it. The seat is placed on the iron frame. The height is about 4 meters. It is divided into three layers of characters. The upper layer is a baby about 10 months old, symbolizing the \"Prince\" or \"God of Heaven\". The middle layer is the \"monarch and minister\" and \"general and minister\" played by a child about 10 years old. It is the protagonist who puts makeup on based on the plot of the story. The lower layer is a middle-aged man, called a sedan chair and a samurai, and the left and right are guards, one character, and one or more units form a complete story. The night story began in the Qing Dynasty, which was to add a Beidou Seven Star Lamp (a lantern that symbolizes longevity) to the story table. During the day, \"carrying stories\" is for peace and peace, and at night, \"carrying stories\" is for health and longevity. Letting children play the characters in the story is for the hope that the descendants will grow up happily and become useful talents. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe story of raising the purple plums in the fields\n\n\n\n\nNewly modified story \"Five Beauties Pictures\"\n\n\n\n\nZhumei's story relies on the collective inheritance of the folk, and learn from each other in practice. Only when applying makeup requires professional knowledge and basic skills, one-on-one master-apprentice inheritance, and now it has begun to be passed on through school teaching. Zhumei's story aims to entertain gods and people, integrating ideological, artistic and ornamentality, and integrating it with folk beliefs and folk customs. This distinctive local folk activities have immeasurable social value in cultivating people's sentiments, inheriting traditional virtues, and building a harmonious countryside.\n\nProject protection unit: Lianyuan City Cultural Center\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nLiu Qiyue (November 1962-) is a Han nationality, from Yunxiao Village, Longtang Town, Lianyuan City, Hunan Province, and a representative inheritor of the national intangible cultural heritage of the carriage (Zhumeixiong Story).

It has been passed down from the Ming and Qing dynasties to this day and has been passed down to this day.\n　　\n\nThe sentences of Xinhua mountain songs are in line with each other, and there are many slang and dialects, which are rich in rap flavor. It can be divided into two categories: high-sing and flat-sing (low-sing). High-sing mountain songs are mainly popular in high-altitude areas, with high tone, long-distance sounds and free rhythms. They include both solo and duet. There is a \"extra-high accent\" \"Wuwa Mountain Song\" in Fengjiashan. Only top singers can sing it. False voices are often used when singing, so it is also called \"sharp voice\" mountain song. There is also a kind of \"Rolling Banshan Song\", which has a very high sound and is very jumping. It often starts with one person and ends with a majestic \"Haha\" sound, with a magnificent aura. \"Liuliu Mountain Song\" is quite popular in Xinhua County, and is named after the word \"Liuliu\" is added in the middle of each half of the sentence. Low-pronunciation mountain songs are mostly popular in hilly plains, with lower tones and shorter drags, and there are also solos and duets.\n　　\n\n\n\n\nTraditional Xinhua folk songs can be divided into labor songs, current affairs songs, ritual songs, pottery love songs, etc. according to their content. Representative works include \"Zi Shuitan Song\", \"No Breedy Room\", \"Dongshi Song\", etc. There is a high-pronunciation mountain song \"It's hard to guess when the gods descend to earth\" that once went to Huairen Hall in Zhongnanhai to sing for central leaders such as Mao Zedong, and became the most famous work of Xinhua mountain songs.\n　　\n\nThe Xinhua folk song comprehensively and vividly reflects the folk customs and cultural traditions of the Meishan area and is an important material for studying and understanding Hunan culture and Meishan culture. At present, this ancient folk song style is in an endangered state, and rescue and protection are imminent."

Its construction skills are mainly circulated in Tongdao Dong Autonomous County and surrounding Dong ethnic areas in Hunan Province. \n\n\n\n\nThe Dong ethnic wooden buildings in the tunnel have a long history, mainly including two types: houses and public buildings. Among them, the stilt wooden buildings in the house are built on the terrain and are completely living spaces with practicality as their main purpose; public buildings include drum towers, stages, well pavilions, village gates, wind and rain bridges, etc. They are surrounded by mountains and waters and gather in groups, with beautiful shapes and exquisite craftsmanship. Dong wooden buildings are mortise-cut, beam-cut arches, and column-loading beams. They do not use a single iron nail, but are all connected by mortise-tension, reflecting the extraordinary building craftsmanship of Dong craftsmen. Dong craftsmen never draw drawings or make models, everything is controlled by the ink master. The Mo Zhengshi is the \"supreme commander\" of the Dong national construction project. Before the start of construction, the ink master needs to measure the foundation, determine the basic frame of the building based on the terrain, then scrape the bamboo off the green skin, and use a curved ruler, bamboo pen and chisel to accurately write the sizes and sizes of hundreds of columns, melons, beams, beams, plates, eyes and other components of varying lengths and sizes on it, making it into a \"scented pole\" (or \"stem pole\"), which states the various water steps from the spine to the eaves, including double eaves and eaves, the height scale of the activity space at each level, the size of the mortise of the vertical and horizontal two-way beams, and the size of the lifting of the top edges of the two-slope-top building frames. The craftsmen made all the carved parts with hand saws, chisels, axes, wooden planers and long-headed picks on the \"Trojan horse\", and finally cleverly combined and built them on the site. Dong craftsmen also use a set of architectural symbols passed down from generation to generation, usually with 26 symbols, but only 13 are commonly used, and no one can recognize them except ink masters and craftsmen. In the design of Dong wooden buildings, they follow the laws of balance, symmetry and harmony. Continuously summarized and developed over thousands of years of practice, making the structure of the through-bucket and lifting beams more perfect, the mortise and tenon fitting are more solid, the joints are meticulous, and the design and layout are more refined and reasonable. \n\n\n\n\nThe Dong wooden structure construction skills are characterized by master-apprentice inheritance and generational inheritance. According to the inheritance context, each village has two to three inheritance branches. The branches are led by \"Mo Shi\" to form a group of teachings. \"Mo Shi\" is the main inheritor of the Dong wooden structure construction skills, and shoulders the inheritance and unified cooperation of skills. The exquisite and extraordinary architectural skills of Dong craftsmen make Dong wooden architecture one of the symbols of Dong culture. It is integrated with the simple folk customs of the Dong village, showing the culture and history of the Dong people, full of strong nationality and locality, and is a pearl in the classical Chinese national architecture. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Tongdao Dong Autonomous County Intangible Cultural Heritage Protection Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nLi Feng'an\n\n(August 1941 -) Male, Dong ethnic group, from Laowan Village, Xianxi Town, Tongdong Autonomous County, Hunan Province, a provincial representative inheritor of Dong ethnic group wooden structure construction skills (Tangdong ethnic group wooden structure construction skills). \n\nHe learned from Li Caihua and began to take charge of ink in 1964 and took his apprenticeship. He has been engaged in the construction of Dong wood structures for a long time.

It was originally an unknown temple, also known as Bao'en Temple. It is located in Yongfu Village, Jiuyidong Village, Jiuyishan. It was renamed Yongfu Temple in the fifth year of Taiping Xingguo in the Song Dynasty (980). It can be seen that Yongzhou Buddhist music originated from the Southern and Northern Dynasties and was mostly produced.\n\n\n\n\nAfter his master was created, he was widely circulated among the people by the guardians and lay Buddhists, and modern folk music was derived. The folk music was brought into the temple by lay Buddhists, and the masters recreated it and innovated it.\n\n\n\n\nThe basic content of Yongzhou Buddhist music: 1. Music used for rituals, such as praise, chant, blessing, ritual, and mantra. 2. Instrumental music played by using musical instruments in Buddhist activities. This type of music flow is usually held in some large temples and grand Buddhist activities. The songs played are often sets, composed of multiple musical cards. 3. Some \"miscellaneous songs\" that are closely related to folk music. This type of song is usually not sung in temples, but it is very popular among the people, has a great influence, and has obvious local characteristics.\n\n\n\n\nThe rhythm of Yongzhou Buddhist music is slow and peaceful, with a bit of folk music, but it is also fresh and refined, extraordinary and saint. It mainly uses five notes, with few up and down keys, and basically uses C keys. The beginning and the end of the song echo each other (the melody is repeated). The differences in the songs mostly appear in the middle section, with a strong sense of rhythm, mainly 2/4 beats, 4/4 beats, and a special 3/4 beat and 4/6 beats. It is solemn and pure, and contains compassion, which makes people move after hearing it, feel happy and have a kind heart. It is a pure lotus blooming brightly in the music garden."

It has a history of more than 1,600 years.\n\n\n\n\nThe Yao Yao Song crosses the mountain is an oral poem for the Yao people to express their emotions and aspirations, an expression of the voice of the Yao people, and a mirror of social development, historical process, era life and customs.

The county cultural department has collected and sorted out the songs of Yao Yao from the mountains many times. The superior cultural and artistic departments often go deep into the Yao area of ​​the county to collect folk songs. \"The Collection of Yao Songs in Lanshan County\" and \"The Collection of Yao Music in Lanshan County\" have been published.\n\n\n\n\nThe Yao Yao Song has been a manifestation of the joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness of the Yao people since ancient times. It was produced in productive labor and grew up in social struggle. It is an indispensable cultural life and spiritual food for the Yao people.\n\n\n\n\nThe history of Yao Yao Songs in the mountains has a long history. As early as the Jin Dynasty, there was a record of \"using mixed fish meat, knocking on the trough and singing it to sacrifice Panhu\". The \"Seasonal Sacrifice of Panwang\" by the Tang Dynasty poet Liu Yuxi's \"Song of the Manzi\" was sacrificed by songs. From this, it can be inferred that the initial formation of Yao Song was between the Tang and Song dynasties. The Blue Mountain Yao Song (including the Mountain Yao Song and the Pingdi Yao Song) was only widely popular during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Until the \"Republic of China\", it was still \"the song fell before the tears rose, and the bitter song sang the green Yao Mountain.\"\n\n\n\n\nAfter liberation, party and government departments at all levels attached great importance to the literature and art of the Yao people, especially the Yao Yao Songs of the Mountains were well developed.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1962, the amateur author He Shijie of Lanshan County took advantage of his work to collect more than 100 songs of Yao Yao Songs in the county; in 1963, the first Yao Song Contest in the county was held; in 1964, the Yao Mountain Yao female singers Pan Jianmei and Pan Guiying participated in the national amateur art performance with their own Yao songs \"Singing to the Chairman\" and \"I Want to Come Back\". After the performance, Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou and other party and state leaders took photos with the actors.\n\nThe Yao Yao Song is an improvised creation created and sung by the Yao people themselves. It promotes the development of national belief and culture through family ancestral inheritance, ethnic exchanges, handwritten manuscripts passed down from generation to generation, and the myth of \"The king of Pan sets the sky and the earth, and the three sisters sets the lyrics and the songs\" and is also an indispensable and important part of the spiritual pillar of the nation. This is the status, role and value of the Coast Mountain Yao Yao Song in its own nation."

People were injured and killed, and they ordered boats to save them.\" \"Daozhou Chronicles\" records that in the 36th year of Wanli in the Ming Dynasty, the prefectural official Han Ziqi confiscated 40 dragon boats, removed the head and tail, and connected the water to the south floating bridge to form a water south to build on the Xiaoshui River. The \"Daozhou Chronicles\" was compiled in the third year of Guangxu in the Qing Dynasty: \"On May, the dragon boats in the city raced across the East and West continents, and the drums were noisy, and the viewers were like blockages.\" The customs of dragon boats in Daozhou are mainly based on villages and clans, and are mainly based on dragon boats, carving dragon heads, launching and competing for ferries. It integrates a large number of interpersonal interactions, festivals, beliefs, rituals, production skills, sports competitions, herbs, food, folk legends and other folk life and cultural connotations. There are three types of dragon heads in Daozhou dragon boats: one is the dragon head (colors include red, gold, yellow, red, white, blue, and black), the other is the tiger head (colors include gold, yellow, red, white, and black), and the third is the phoenix head (called golden phoenix), owl head, eagle head, etc. The dragon, tiger, and phoenix head are divided into two types: open mouth and micro mouth (closed mouth). The shape and color of each dragon boat have their own origins and are determined based on the temple worshipped by each village. The main material of the faucet is willow, and the hull is mostly made of camphor wood. The instrument has cowhide drums, gongs, batons and rowing wood pulp. Before the competition, the Daozhou dragon boat will hold folk activities to create a new ship with \"mounting horses\" and \"falling horses\" ceremonies; when the new dragon boat is launched, the \"falling dragon\", \"warming dragon\", \"building a platform for sacrifice\", \"pulling the plowhead fire\", and \"climbing the Yin boat\" are held. The Daozhou dragon boat has a flat head and a raised tail, with its head lower than its tail. The dragon head of the bow is movable. Different ancestral temples are equipped with different shapes of dragon heads, and colorful flags are decorated at the tail. There are 20 rowers in a boat, one person with one palm, drummer, gong and helmsman. During the competition, one person on the bow of the boat is called the \"palm dragon head\". It is the commander-in-chief of the entire boat. Most of the people in the village are respected; one person on the stern of the boat is the helm, and most of them are experienced veterans; the drums and gongs are in the middle, the drums and gongs are in the cabin, and the drums are standing tall on the boat. The radial hand listens to the drum and the radial, with a slow and moderate attitude. During the competition, several dragon boats were striving for progress, with gongs and drums shaking, oars slashing silver waves, and hitting water like flying. While paddling, the radiator shouted loudly, \"Shake, ahhh.\" The two sides of the Taiwan Strait cheered and the scene was shocking. It fully reflects the bold, tough, strong and heroic character of Daoxian people. The customs of dragon boats in Daozhou are generally social inheritance, while the production of dragon boats, dragon heads, cowhide drums, etc. is highly professional, belongs to the master-apprentice inheritance, and is mainly passed down from generation to generation within the family. There are currently hull production inheritors such as Jiang Zhengle and Liu Xingrong and dragon-engraving inheritors such as Chen Binshou and Zhou Chengyun. Every year from the Dragon Boat Festival on the first day of the fifth lunar month to the fifth day of the lunar calendar, Dao County holds an unprecedented dragon boat race. It is of great significance to enhancing people's unity, enhancing mass physical fitness, enriching mass cultural life, and promoting traditional culture.

The book of the Nvs is an ancient text. Because there are no ancient cultural relics and are not recorded in historical records, the time of its origin cannot be determined. Because it is specially used by women, the academic community calls it \"women's book\".

The language recorded in the Native Chinese dialect (Yongming dialect) popular in the Jiangyong area, is a syllable phonetic character. Its methods and methods for marking language are unique, and can be homophoned and replicated. It can use only more than 400 characters to write seven-character rhymes of more than a thousand characters. The characters in the female calligraphy are long diamond-shaped, with slender and even strokes, similar to mosquitoes and ants. People call it \"the word \"long-legged mosquito\" or \"ant\".

According to legend, the legend of Shennong making plows originated from Leishan, Rucheng. According to legend, one day Shennong came to Shitou Village at the foot of Leishan Mountain in Rucheng. Seeing Shitou Village lush trees and beautiful scenery, he went up the mountain to see what was going on. Shennong climbed up the branches, and broke a branch because he tried too hard, and then inserted the broken branch into the solid soil. Shennong had a question about this phenomenon: Why can this broken branch be inserted into the hard deep soil? He pulled out the broken branch and looked closely, and found that the top of the broken mouth was extremely sharp, just like the blade now. Shennongdun’s inspiration: If the wood is cut into sharp edges to turn over the soil, it should be very convenient and labor-saving. So I chose a straight log and made a handle about 3 feet long and 2 inches in diameter (because I was first in Leishan, this handle was later called \"lei\"), split the solid large wood into wooden boards, take out a rectangular wooden board about 8 inches long and 6 inches wide, cut the lower edge as thin as a knife blade, and dig it into a rectangular notch about 2 inches wide and 4 inches long in the center of the lower edge to make a blade shaped like an air-tight cloth (later called \"lei\"), and then tie the \"lei\" firmly to the lower end of the \"lei\" (later called \"lei\"). Later, Shennong taught people to make the plows he created, use plows to open up wastelands and sow grains, and opened up agricultural civilization."

The girl was at the time, and observed the punishment of the two daughters.' The two daughters were surrendered to Gui Fei, and the concubine was in Yu.\" \"Records of the Grand Historian: The Basic Annals of the Five Emperors\" says: \"Yao said, 'How can I try it!' So the two daughters of Yao's wife, observed the virtue of the two daughters. Shun ordered the two daughters of Gui Fei, as if the wife was polite.\" Qu Yuan's \"Nine Songs\" during the Warring States Period: \"The emperor's son descended to the northern bank, his eyes were full of wives and sad. The swaying autumn wind, the waves of the Dongting shore were under the leaves.\" Liu Xiang of the Western Han Dynasty said: \"The emperor's son came to the north bank, his eyes were full of wives and sad. The wind was swaying in the autumn courtyard, and the wood leaves were under the leaves.\" Liu Xiang of the Western Han Dynasty \"Biography of the Lie Nu·Biography of Mother Yi\": \"Yuanshi Ehuang Nuying, the daughter of Emperor Yao, the concubines of Emperor Yao, inherited Shun from his subordinates to respect the affairs.\" Zhang Hua of Jin Dynasty said: \"The two daughters of Yao, the Ehuang Nuying of Shun, were called Mrs. Xiang, the emperor died, and the Ehuang Nuying cried, and the bamboo was swept with tears, and the bamboo was spotted.\" Song Xin Qiji's lyrics of \"Langtaosha·Fu Yu Meirencao\": \"The children are the same in this relationship, and the past is hazy. The tears on Xiang E bamboo are thick.\" Feng Menglong's \"Love History\" by Feng Menglong of the Ming Dynasty: \"The two concubines of Ehuang Nuying... I missed Shun, and shed bamboo with tears, and the bamboo was spotted with spots.

    "description-en": "Bee sting therapy\n\n\n\n\nSummary of the theory of bee sting therapy\n\n\n\n\nChen's bee therapy is a traditional Chinese medicine diagnosis and treatment, also known as \"Chen's bee acupuncture therapy\", which is mainly circulated in the urban area of ​​Chenzhou City and Guiyang County, Hunan Province. \n\n\n\n\nChen's bee therapy can be traced back to the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty. It was summarized by the experience of using bee needles to treat rheumatism in the neighbors who accumulated beekeeping by Chen Zhikai, the eldest son of Guiyang beekeeper Chen Xizhen, and his beekeeping. Bee therapy is the general term for bee sting therapy and bee product medical treatment. Traditional Chinese medicine uses honey, beewax, bee seeds, pollen, etc. for clinical treatment, and there are records of bee chambers and bee needles as used as medicine. Chen's bee therapy uses bee needles as natural high-precision ultra-micro-biological syringes and bee venom pharmacology to treat some immune system, bone and joint system, and cardiovascular system diseases. The treatment process is divided into three stages: skin test sensitivity, bee needle adaptation, and treatment course diagnosis and treatment. That is, first use bee needle to sting to verify whether the patient has a bee venom allergic reaction. On the basis of ensuring safety, then determine the diagnosis and treatment course according to the degree of the disease. At the same time, take it orally and apply it comprehensively to form the effect of treating symptoms when urgent and treating the root cause when slow. According to the sensitivity of different bodies to bee venom, the methods of using stings in Chen's bee therapy are divided into stings, stings, scatters and stings. Stinging means gently clamping the bee's chest with a bee clip, and directly applying the bee sting on the acupoints. It has the strongest pain and is mostly used for internal organ diseases and other symptoms. It is pricked on the main acupoint.

Lanxi Mountain Songs gradually evolved from the labor romance created by local ancestors during water fishing and swamp farming. Depending on the degree of labor heavy work and different labor methods, folk songs naturally produce different rhythms and tones.

The more labor-intensive the more you use the higher the accent, the more you use falsetto. Quick-pin is generally sung in high-sounding accents.

The flowing water board is also called \"scattered board\", which belongs to a single beat. Lanxi mountain songs have rich musical cards, which can be divided into four types: owl mountain songs, field songs, housework mountain songs and minor mountain songs. The singing format is flexible, with both the singing style of drama and the singing style of singing and dancing. The singing methods include solo, duet, one-leading and multi-vocal chorus, etc. His representative works \"Ten Fleece\" and other works were included in \"Chinese Folk Songs Collection·Yiyang County Volume\". Lanxi mountain songs have either cultivated or promoted the birth and development of art forms such as flower drums, flower drum operas and musicals in Yiyang. It is a natural expression of the voice of the working people and a true portrayal of the social life of every era.

    "description": "\n\n\n梅王塑像梅王传说流传于湖南省安化县、新化县、涟源市等梅山文化中心地区。 晚唐时期，安化、新化等县统称梅山，聚居着苗族、瑶族。公元886年，当地民众拥戴汉族人扶汉阳为王，首府设在梅城，民间称其为“梅王”或“扶王”。传说扶汉阳是汉阳人，原是后周臣子，因赵匡胤追捕他，“避罪匿梅山”。为帮助苗、瑶生存，他勇挑重担，领导梅山瑶苗建立防卫队伍，号称具有三千蜂兵和三千蛇兵，每天习武练兵，与敌作战常常出奇制胜。“九关十八锁之战”使王仝全军覆灭。梅王关爱民生。他与邻郡官员、商家，建立了书信联络，引进布匹、食盐，保证了民用；对孤寡老人作出了“五养一”规定，即五户养一人，生养死葬负责到底。他豁免苗、瑶繁重赋役，使少数民族在经济上减轻了负担。宋太平兴国二年，朝廷派兵围剿梅山，梅王壮烈牺牲。这位汉族人民的儿子，为保卫少数民族生存，流尽了最后一滴血。民间传说，梅王亡故后已成神升天。人们把梅王敬为神灵，各家的神龛上都写着“梅城助福正神”或“梅城福德正神”，把扶王请上神龛进行家祭。安化、宁乡、桃江三县边界的人民每年正月十一都到新桥庙冲扶王庙，为梅王拜生日，有关梅王的传说代代相传。苗瑶人民为了表示对他的纪念和爱戴，将其战斗过的山头命名“扶王山”，战斗所在地的桥梁命名“扶王桥”，建扶王庙10多座。还有许多人为儿子取名“扶佑”“扶保”“扶吉。梅王传说主要包括梅王义重如山、关爱民生、亡故显灵、护佑人民等内容，因历史事件发生，通过民间神秘色彩的渲染而不断发展，由此衍生了与神灵崇拜有关的民俗文化。 千百年来，梅王传说通过各种祭祀仪式和口口相传的民间传说在梅山地区广泛传颂。梅王领导苗、瑶族人反对朝廷镇压和封锁，守土护民，抗敌牺牲，体现出的强烈的民族团结精神，堪称历史上汉、苗、瑶族团结互助的一曲颂歌。 项目保护单位：安化县文化馆\n\n\n",
    "title-en": "Legend of the Plum King",
    "description-en": "The statue of the plum king is circulated in the Meishan Cultural Center areas such as Anhua County, Xinhua County, Lianyuan City, Hunan Province. During the late Tang Dynasty, Anhua, Xinhua and other counties were collectively known as Meishan, and Miao and Yao ethnic groups lived in it. In 886 AD, the local people supported Han people to support Hanyang as king, and the capital was set up in Meicheng, which people called it \"Plum King\" or \"Plum King\". Legend has it that Fu Hanyang was from Hanyang, and was originally a minister of the Later Zhou Dynasty. Because Zhao Kuangyin pursued him, he \"didn't hide in Meishan.\" In order to help Miao and Yao survive, he bravely shouldered the heavy responsibilities and led Meishan Yao Miao to establish a defense team. He claimed to have three thousand bee soldiers and three thousand snake soldiers. He practiced martial arts every day and often won surprises when fighting against the enemy. The \"Battle of Nine Passes and Eighteen Locks\" destroyed Wang Tong's entire army. The Plum King cares about people's livelihood. He established letter contacts with officials and merchants from neighboring counties, introduced cloth and salt to ensure civil use; he made the \"five care and one\" regulations for the elderly orphans, that is, five households raise one person, and they will be responsible for their birth, raising, raising, and burying. He exempted Miao and Yao from heavy taxes and service, reducing the burden on ethnic minorities economically. In the second year of Taiping Xingguo in the Song Dynasty, the imperial court sent troops to encircle Meishan, and King Mei died heroically. The son of the Han people shed his last drop of blood to protect the survival of ethnic minorities. According to folk legend, after the death of the Mei King, he became a god and ascended to heaven. People respected the King of Plum as a god, and the shrines of each family said \"Plum City Helps the Lord of Blessings\" or \"Plum City Good Deeds the Lord of Blessings\" and invited the King of Plum City to the shrine for a family sacrifice. The people on the borders of Anhua, Ningxiang and Taojiang counties go to Xinqiao Temple to Chongfuwang Temple every year on the 11th of the first lunar month to celebrate the birthday of the plum king. The legend about the plum king has been passed down from generation to generation. In order to express his commemoration and love for him, the Miao Yao people named the mountain where they fought \"Fuwang Mountain\", the bridge where the battle was located \"Fuwang Bridge\", and built more than 10 Fuwang Temples. Many people named their sons \"Fuyou\", \"Fubao\" and \"Fuji\". The legend of the Prince of Mei mainly includes the morality of the Prince of Mei as heavy as a mountain, caring for people's livelihood, showing off the dead, protecting the people, etc. Due to historical events, it has been continuously developed through the rendering of mysterious folk colors, which has led to the folk culture related to the worship of gods. For thousands of years, the legend of the Prince of Mei has been widely circulated in the Meishan area through various sacrificial rituals and word-of-mouth folk legends. The legend of the Prince of Mei has led the Miao and Yao people to oppose the suppression and blockade of the imperial court, guarding the land and protecting the people, and fighting the enemy's sacrifice, and reflecting the strong spirit of national unity and mutual assistance, which can be regarded as a hymn for the unity and mutual assistance of the Han, Miao and Yao people in history.

    "description-en": "Meishan paper-cutting is a folk paper-cutting art form that gradually developed under the mist of Meishan culture. It is mainly circulated in Anhua County, Hunan Province and radiates to surrounding counties and cities. \n\nMeishan was vast in ancient times. According to the \"Baoqing Prefecture Chronicle·Da Zheng Ji\" during the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, \"The Meishan River Cave is thousands of miles above and below. It connects to Tan in the east and Shao in the south; it connects to Chen in the west, and to tripod in the north.\" According to local folk legends, the representative double goose window flowers in Meishan paper-cut can be traced back to the unique wedding custom of using geese as a hijab when Meishan was stationed in Meishan in the early Western Han Dynasty. In the \"Anhua County Chronicles\" of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty, there are customs records such as \"using paper money to hang graves on Qingming Festival\", \"burning paper clothes, paper money, and money during the Zhongyuan Festival... chiseling paper wallets to seal and burn them\", and \"removing stickers to the door\". Such paper-cutting customs have been preserved intact locally and have a broad mass base. Meishan paper cutting can be found in two types: flower cutting and flower filing. The flower-cutting style is childish and simple, and the pattern of filed flowers is complex and exquisite, with various forms such as flat, three-dimensional, monochrome, color set, and color addition. Use scissors to cut local soil to make red paper, which can be cut 4-6 layers at a time. The cut patterns mainly include frangipani, door paper, double goose wedding window flowers, cover bowl flowers, birthday flowers and other daily decorations. The flosser flowers for giving birth are less than 5 cm square and are exquisite and unique; the door paper used for New Year's Festival has a format of 138 cm long and 34 cm wide, which is very atmospheric and warm. The materials for flower filing tools include camphor wood pads, files, various colored flower papers, etc., which can reach more than 20 layers at a time. After the filing is completed, it must be processed using color matching and coloring techniques. The products mainly include Nuo dance masks, paper movie series, as well as funeral and sacrificial paper cutting such as eyewear, flower houses, road guide banners, mourning hall paper, and altar door flags. The flower house is made of bamboo strips as a bracket and is made of filed flowers. There are more than 30 patterns and more than 150 filed flower slices on a traditional \"flower house\", which will take several days to complete. \n\nThere are different practitioners in Meishan paper-cutting and flower-cutting. The inheritance of flower-cutting is mainly based on the Xiangjiaying Xiang family in Jiulong Township, Anhua County, and the inheritance of flower-cutting is mainly based on the Jiang family in Yaotou Village, Xianxi Town, Anhua County. Meishan paper-cutting is widely used in different life stages of local people, such as birth, old age, sickness, death, marriage, funeral and sacrifice. It is a folk art form jointly created by the people with the development of history. It is an intuitive reflection of the spiritual pursuit and thoughts and emotions of the people in Meishan area. \n\nProject protection unit: Hunan Meishan Paper Cutting Culture Co., Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeishan Paper Cut Egg Flower\n\n\n\n\nSacrifice supplies \"flower house\" Sacrifice supplies \"flower house\""

It is the charm of this water town and country that constitutes the unique geographical environment for the growth and inheritance of folk culture. The unique folk dance - the Earth Flower Drum was derived from this land.\n　　\n\nNanxian Dihuagu originated in the third year of Jiaqing in the Qing Dynasty (1796). It evolved based on folk folk songs, minor tunes and labor romances. With its simple and rough movements, bright and high-pitched music, lively and free performance, rich atmosphere of life and unique artistic style, it is deeply rooted in the people. The local flower drum in Nanxian has many forms of expression, such as pair of flower drums, bamboo horse flower drums, and dragon flower drums. The double-colored flower drum is also called \"single flower drum\". Once the two men dress up, they will play \"condoms\" and \"turn the nest\" according to the meaning of \"Dec-Yue Lang\", \"Mopping the floor stool\", \"October sister\", \"Picking tea\", \"Flower arrangement\", \"Fan tune\", and \"Sending wealth song\". They are good at using fans and handkerchiefs to express the emotions and personalities of characters. The bamboo horse earthen flower drum is a form of performance that evolved on the basis of the pair earthen flower drum. The protagonist is added to the samurai, holding a horse whip, and covering various colors of fabrics or paper bamboo horses on the shoulders or waist. It is interspersed with the earthen flower drums and the Dan. Some are also equipped with somersaults. The scene is majestic and the performance is delicate. The performance program of the flower drum and dan and ugliness in the dragon are slightly different from the first two forms. There is \"sending wealth\" when entering the door, and \"saying east when going out\", and using \"playing beads\", \"lifting the well\", \"plate board\", \"butterfly\" and \"sleeping arhat\" or posing the words \"floor harvest\" to create a festive and auspicious atmosphere.\n　　\n\n\n\n\nNanxian Dihuagu passed through the enlightenment period of the Qing Dynasty, the development period after the founding of New China and the heyday after the 1980s, which played a crucial role in the enlightenment period of Hunan Huagu Opera.

Hunan folk have always used Simo Decoction to \"equal\" newborns, treat children's gastrointestinal diseases, and regulate gastrointestinal function. After traditional Chinese medicine experts carefully studied ancient medical books, extensive surveys and research on folk remedies and proven prescriptions, absorbed the experience of famous old Chinese medicine doctors in various places, Simo Decoction consists of four Chinese herbal medicines such as Muxiang, Citrus aurantium, Acornia medicinal herbs, and betel nut fruit core. Wood fragrance is the main medicine. It tastes spicy, bitter, and warms the nature. It has the effects of warming the middle, promoting qi, relieving pain, strengthening the spleen, eliminating food and guiding stagnation. Citrus aurantium tastes bitter, sour, slightly cold in nature, and passes through the lungs, spleen, liver, and stomach, and enters the large intestine meridian. Atractylodes have a wide range of pharmacological activities, antibacterial and anti-virus, can increase the secretion of digestive juices, and keep qi and reduce backwardness. The core of betel nut breaks the qi and eliminates stagnation, and Xuanyong clears stagnation. The combination of four Chinese medicinal materials can be described as a \"strong combination\" for gastrointestinal diseases, with orderly dispatch and moderate advancement and retreat. Classical medicine and medical prescription documents have many records of the combination. The rhizomes of Muxiang and Aconite are dried and used as medicine. After the citrus aurantium is dried, the capsule is removed after the betel nut is dried, and after the shell is removed after the nucleus is dried. When grinding, take an appropriate amount of water and place it in a pound bowl or a large porcelain bowl. Take the tangerine peel, Citrus aurantium, and betel nut cores respectively, and use the same pound bowl for each grinding. However, after grinding the first flavour, pour it into the medicine jar, then take the water again into the bowl and grind the second flavour. And so on. Do not grind the previous flavour. The dosage can be determined by the patient's age and severity of the patient. In particular, these four medicines are divided into \"male and female\" medicine. The rhizomes of the public medicine are slightly longer and straight, while the rhizomes of the mother medicine are slightly shorter and more wide, and have a \"belly shape\". Traditional methods emphasize \"male and female\" combination, and the medicinal effect is better. The ancient method of Simo Tang is mainly passed down from master and apprentice and family, and has been passed down by the people of Hunan for thousands of years. It fully explores the medicinal properties of the four medicinal herbs such as Muxiang, Citrus aurantium, Acornia and Betel nut, which can smooth qi, reduce reversal and eliminate accumulation, and has unique therapeutic effects on gastrointestinal diseases and Qi reversal symptoms in infants and young children.

    "description-en": "The finished flower brick tea \"flower tiles\" were historically called \"flower rolls\". Because a roll of tea overlaps 1,000 taels of old scales, it is also called \"thousand taels of tea\". Its production skills are mainly circulated in Anhua County, Hunan Province and are mastered by major comprehensive black tea manufacturers. In the past, transportation was difficult and tea was inconvenient. The cylindrical flower roll tea was conveniently tied to both sides of the back of the livestock. But when retail and drinking, you need to use a hacksaw to make a piece of blade. This is not convenient, and tea is also easy to waste. In addition, during the construction process, there are many labor, high costs, high labor intensity, and difficult production. Therefore, in 1958, \"Huajuan\" was transformed into rectangular brick tea. It has become a new variety of black tea and is welcomed by the people in the distribution area. The flower tiles only change the flower rolls into brick shape, and the inner quality is basically close. There are patterns on the four sides of the brick surface to show the difference from other brick teas. There are two types of flower tiles and tea: special flower tiles and ordinary flower tiles. The raw materials for special flower tiles are mainly secondary Anhua black tea; the raw materials for ordinary flower tiles are the same as those for Huajuan tea, which are most third-grade black tea and a small amount of lowered second-grade black tea, with a total content of no more than 15%. The semi-finished product is made through low-temperature cold fermentation, seven-star stove baking, screening, sorting, stacking and other processes, and then the finished product is made through the processes such as tea, steaming tea, filling box, pressing, cooling, brick removal, brick repair, brick inspection, drying, packaging, etc. The net weight of conventional products is 2 kg per piece, and the specifications are generally 35×18×3.5 cm. The brick body is pressed tightly, the brick surface is dark brown, moist and smooth, the twill pattern on the four sides is clear and the edges are clear, making it a work of art in black tea. The traditional way of cooking is to mash the brick tea first, moisten the tea with boiling water, and then boil it in a pot or pot with cold water. During the cooking process, it is also necessary to stir continuously to make the tea juice fully leaching. When cooking, you can also add seasonings by mixing the drinks. After stopping the fire and filtering the tea, divide it and drink it hot. Its aroma is pure and distant, with a strong and slightly astringent taste, with a significant sweetness, a red and yellow soup color, and the leaves are old, tender and evenly symmetrical. The production technology of Anhua flower brick tea has gone through two stages: family inheritance and industry collective inheritance. From the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, using human, animal power or hydraulic pressure to make tea bricks, to now, fully mechanized production has been achieved. Anhua flower brick tea has a unique production process, has a large aging and transformation space and collection value, and has profound tea culture connotation.

    "description-en": "Anhua Sanjian Tea\n\n\n\n\nAnhua Tianjian Tea is also known as \"Xiangjian No. 1\". It is a typical representative of Anhua black tea and is mainly circulated in Anhua County, Hunan Province. \n\n\n\n\nAnhua black tea was mostly tributed by the imperial court. In the fifth year of Xining in the Song Dynasty (1072), Anhua opened a tea farm and made tea to pay tribute, which was called \"Sibao Gong Tea\". During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, Anhua Jiangnan Dehe Tea Store used the local black hair tea with tender local raw materials to process it as loose tea, which was divided into seven types: bud tips, white hair tips, Tianjian, Gongjian, Township tips, Shengjian, and bundled tips. As valuable gifts, especially the \"three tips\" of Tianjian, Gongjian and Shengjian. Tianjian uses first-level black tea as the main ingredients and a small amount of second-level upgraded tea is added. The tribute tea is mainly composed of second-grade black tea, with a small amount of raw materials for first-grade decline and third-grade improvement. The raw tea used in raw tips is relatively coarse and old, most of which are flakes and contain more stems. Tianjian tea is purely handmade, divided into two stages: black tea making and Tianjian tea making. Black tea is made from fresh leaves with one bud, one leaf to one bud, four leaf or a relatively tender degree of pair of leaves, and is made by finishing, rolling, pile-up fermenting, first drying, and until the seven-star stove is dry. Tianjian tea processing is divided into three major processes: screening, even stacking and construction. The black tea is made by round sieve, air selection and picking. The semi-finished tea embryos are stacked in accordance with the quality standards to make their quality even. Then, Tianjian tea is made. The production of Tianjian tea is to weigh a certain weight of tea, soften it by steaming and put it into a bamboo basket to make it pressed. The micro-pressed acquired Tianjian tea is naturally cooled and dried in the bamboo strip packaging, and the moisture content is less than 12% before it leaves the factory. The bamboo basket packaging is good in breathability, which is conducive to the oxidation and ripening of Tianjian tea, removing odors, and maintaining the aging fragrance of the tea. \n\n\n\n\nAnhua Tianjian tea production technology has developed well in productive protection. In ancient times, Tianjian Tea gave noble gifts to tea merchants from officials, wealthy businessmen, relatives and friends. During the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty (around 1825), it was listed as a tribute and was exclusively for royal drinking. It has now become a fashionable drink for the wealthy people in the south. This tea can be made or brewed, which is suitable for both clean drinks and milk tea. Especially in teahouses in the south, brewing tea pots and cold drink tea at home, are all good choices. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Hunan Baishaxi Tea Factory Co., Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXiao Yiping\n\n(February 1964—) Male, Han nationality, from Xiaoyan Town, Anhua County, Hunan Province, senior agronomist, senior tea evaluator, member of the Border Tea Sales Working Group of the National Standardization Technical Committee, member of the National Tea Standardization Technical Committee, and representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of black tea production skills (Anhua Tianjian Tea Production Technology). \n\nHe was born in Baishaxi.

Learning and discussing the skills of Tianjian tea making with generations of tea makers has made him a leading position in the field of traditional Tianjian tea making. In addition to traditional bulk and basket-filled Tianjian, his products have successively developed 1 kilogram Tianjian tea and straight brewing type and other varieties. On the basis of Tianjian Tea, the \"Bajian\" tea production process has been revived, and a variety of tea products such as \"5301 Bajian Tea\" have been developed.

Lanxi in Heshan District, Yiyang City is a tributary of the Zijiang River. Dragon boat racing is held in the local area before the Dragon Boat Festival every year. Lanxi double-radial dragon boat has unique characteristics. It has a large number of people, and the dragon boat is about 30 meters long and about 1.6 meters wide. Generally, long-necked wooden squid-bearded dragon heads are used. The cabin is set according to the number of stars or gods and Buddhas in the sky, and is generally between cabins 18-36. Suppose the 18 cabin is the number of the eighteen arhats, the 24 cabin is the number of the twenty heavens and the four great Vajras, the 28 cabin is the number of the twenty-eight constellations in the heaven, the 32 cabin is the number of the twenty-eight constellations and the four great kings, and the 36 cabin is the number of the thirty-six heavenly gangs. The double-radial dragon boat is rowed by two floors of people. The one who is sitting is called sitting radial, and the one who is standing is called inserting radial, so it is a double-radial. In addition to those who play suona, drums and gongs, fire guns, and steer, a double-radial dragon boat can accommodate more than 140 people. In the production of radial plates, the radial plate sitting on the radial is short and wide, and the sailor sits against the edge of the boat; the radial plate standing on the radial is long and narrow, and the sailor stands with the radial sitting on the radial. The station radial team only lowers the radial when competing or turning around. At other times, they always put the radial plate upside down at their feet to perform and sing. The forms of singing include lead singing, chorus and duet singing. The singing content is very extensive, and the tune is the original \"Dragon Boat Song\" by the people of Lanxi. In addition, there are four radiators sitting in the third and fourth cabins.

There is a bamboo pole with green branches and leaves at the tail in the middle of the boat. An ugly man shook his palm fan and pulled the bamboo pole into a flash. People in Lanxi called it a flash pole. Before the dragon boat goes into the water, sacrificial rituals must be held to recite the \"Sacrificial Text\". Every year from the fifth lunar month (fifth day) to the Dragon Boat Festival, dragon boats from each village will come to Lanxi to compete. Men, women, young and old who come from all directions to watch dragon boats surrounded the ten-mile long dike and blocked the two sides of the river. Firecrackers on both sides shook the sky, shouting one after another. The dragon boats in the water, with neat drum beats and the exciting \"Dragon Boat Song\", rowing forward in a row, and the scene is spectacular. During the Dragon Boat Festival in Lanxi Town every year, people spend a wealth of folk activities such as dragon boat racing, eating rice dumplings, singing folk songs. Its unique double-radial dragon boat culture plays a role in uniting people and inspiring fighting spirit, and also leaves a unique cultural memory for the local people, greatly enhancing their sense of identity and sense of belonging to their hometown.

    "description-en": "The ancient method of Simo Tang inherited by the folk is derived from the Southern Song Dynasty medical classic \"Jisheng Fang\" and is circulated in Yiyang City, Hunan Province. Hunan folk have always used Simo Decoction to \"equal\" newborns, treat children's gastrointestinal diseases, and regulate gastrointestinal function. After traditional Chinese medicine experts carefully studied ancient medical books, extensive surveys and research on folk remedies and proven prescriptions, absorbed the experience of famous old Chinese medicine doctors in various places, Simo Decoction consists of four Chinese herbal medicines such as Muxiang, Citrus aurantium, Acornia medicinal herbs, and betel nut fruit core. Wood fragrance is the main medicine. It tastes spicy, bitter, and warms the nature. It has the effects of warming the middle, promoting qi, relieving pain, strengthening the spleen, eliminating food and guiding stagnation. Citrus aurantium tastes bitter, sour, slightly cold in nature, and passes through the lungs, spleen, liver, and stomach, and enters the large intestine meridian. Atractylodes have a wide range of pharmacological activities, antibacterial and anti-virus, can increase the secretion of digestive juices, and keep qi and reduce backwardness. The core of betel nut breaks the qi and eliminates stagnation, and Xuanyong clears stagnation. The combination of four Chinese medicinal materials can be described as a \"strong combination\" for gastrointestinal diseases, with orderly dispatch and moderate advancement and retreat. Classical medicine and medical prescription documents have many records of the combination. The rhizomes of Muxiang and Aconite are dried and used as medicine. After the citrus aurantium is dried, the capsule is removed after the betel nut is dried, and after the shell is removed after the nucleus is dried. When grinding, take an appropriate amount of water and place it in a pound bowl or a large porcelain bowl. Take the tangerine peel, Citrus aurantium, and betel nut cores respectively, and use the same pound bowl for each grinding. However, after grinding the first flavour, pour it into the medicine jar, then take the water again into the bowl and grind the second flavour. And so on. Do not grind the previous flavour. The dosage can be determined by the patient's age and severity of the patient. In particular, these four medicines are divided into \"male and female\" medicine. The rhizomes of the public medicine are slightly longer and straight, while the rhizomes of the mother medicine are slightly shorter and more wide, and have a \"belly shape\". Traditional methods emphasize \"male and female\" combination, and the medicinal effect is better. The ancient method of Simo Tang is mainly passed down from master and apprentice and family, and has been passed down by the people of Hunan for thousands of years. It fully explores the medicinal properties of the four medicinal herbs such as Muxiang, Citrus aurantium, Acornia and Betel nut, which can smooth qi, reduce reversal and eliminate accumulation, and has unique therapeutic effects on gastrointestinal diseases and Qi reversal symptoms in infants and young children.

In addition to those who play suona, drums and gongs, fire guns, and steer, a double-radial dragon boat can accommodate more than 140 people. In the production of radial plates, the radial plate sitting on the radial is short and wide, and the sailor sits against the edge of the boat; the radial plate standing on the radial is long and narrow, and the sailor stands with the radial sitting on the radial. The station radial team only lowers the radial when competing or turning around. At other times, they always put the radial plate upside down at their feet to perform and sing. The forms of singing include lead singing, chorus and duet singing. The singing content is very extensive, and the tune is the original \"Dragon Boat Song\" by the people of Lanxi. In addition, there are four radiators sitting in the third and fourth cabins. They shook their arms and followed the clanging sound of the drums and drums, and rhythmically tilted the radial plates in the air; in the ninth and tenth cabins, there was also a pair of flower-dance clowns performing specifically. There is a bamboo pole with green branches and leaves at the tail in the middle of the boat. An ugly man shook his palm fan and pulled the bamboo pole into a flash. People in Lanxi called it a flash pole. Before the dragon boat goes into the water, sacrificial rituals must be held to recite the \"Sacrificial Text\". Every year from the fifth lunar month (fifth day) to the Dragon Boat Festival, dragon boats from each village will come to Lanxi to compete. Men, women, young and old who come from all directions to watch dragon boats surrounded the ten-mile long dike and blocked the two sides of the river. Firecrackers on both sides shook the sky, shouting one after another. The dragon boats in the water, with neat drum beats and the exciting \"Dragon Boat Song\", rowing forward in a row, and the scene is spectacular. During the Dragon Boat Festival in Lanxi Town every year, people spend a wealth of folk activities such as dragon boat racing, eating rice dumplings, singing folk songs. Its unique double-radial dragon boat culture plays a role in uniting people and inspiring fighting spirit, and also leaves a unique cultural memory for the local people, greatly enhancing their sense of identity and sense of belonging to their hometown.

Chenhe puppet show entered its heyday in the late Qing Dynasty. It was an artistic form that integrates religious culture, folk skills and opera art, and uses the art of stick-headed puppets as the main expression form. The performance group of Chenhe puppet show is called \"Naotai Ban\", which is one of the three performance forms of Chenhe's high-alloon \"Haotai\" (stage singing), \"Naotai\" (puppet singing), and \"Enjoy the drum\" (sitting and singing). The short-dai team that sings the Chenhe puppet show usually consists of seven to nine people. It is light and simple to wear and cheaply charge, which is very suitable for the needs of the people in the mountainous areas. Chenzhou puppets are puppets with stick heads, which consist of four parts: puppet head, puppet body, raising pole and hand sign. The puppet head has four shapes: Sheng, Dan, Jing and Chou. The biggest feature of puppet show performance is \"there is a mouth but a mouth but a mouth but a mouth but a person is like a person who is not a person who dances with others.\" The repertoire sung by Chenhe puppet show is exactly the same as the repertoire sung by Chenhe opera stage. The most common repertoire is the Liantai play \"Xiangshan\", which is a story of Guanyin's enlightenment. Generally, the repertoire performed by the short-dai team during the day must be \"Xiangshan\", which is called \"Main Opera\". The repertoire performed at night is called \"Flower Opera\", which can be sung any repertoire of Chenhe. The inheritance methods of Chenhe puppet show are generally three types: family inheritance, master-apprentice inheritance, and school teaching inheritance. Chenhe puppet show maintains close relationship with folk religion and customs, integrates folk prayers and artistic activities. It is a rare drama in China that maintains the original ecological performance, and is of great significance to studying the generation and development of Chinese folk opera.

    "description-en": "The finished flower brick tea \"flower tiles\" were historically called \"flower rolls\". Because a roll of tea overlaps 1,000 taels of old scales, it is also called \"thousand taels of tea\". Its production skills are mainly circulated in Anhua County, Hunan Province and are mastered by major comprehensive black tea manufacturers. In the past, transportation was difficult and tea was inconvenient. The cylindrical flower roll tea was conveniently tied to both sides of the back of the livestock. But when retail and drinking, you need to use a hacksaw to make a piece of blade. This is not convenient, and tea is also easy to waste. In addition, during the construction process, there are many labor, high costs, high labor intensity, and difficult production. Therefore, in 1958, \"Huajuan\" was transformed into rectangular brick tea. It has become a new variety of black tea and is welcomed by the people in the distribution area. The flower tiles only change the flower rolls into brick shape, and the inner quality is basically close. There are patterns on the four sides of the brick surface to show the difference from other brick teas. There are two types of flower tiles and tea: special flower tiles and ordinary flower tiles. The raw materials for special flower tiles are mainly secondary Anhua black tea; the raw materials for ordinary flower tiles are the same as those for Huajuan tea, which are most third-grade black tea and a small amount of lowered second-grade black tea, with a total content of no more than 15%. The semi-finished product is made through low-temperature cold fermentation, seven-star stove baking, screening, sorting, stacking and other processes, and then the finished product is made through the processes such as tea, steaming tea, filling box, pressing, cooling, brick removal, brick repair, brick inspection, drying, packaging, etc. The net weight of conventional products is 2 kg per piece, and the specifications are generally 35×18×3.5 cm. The brick body is pressed tightly, the brick surface is dark brown, moist and smooth, the twill pattern on the four sides is clear and the edges are clear, making it a work of art in black tea. The traditional way of cooking is to mash the brick tea first, moisten the tea with boiling water, and then boil it in a pot or pot with cold water. During the cooking process, it is also necessary to stir continuously to make the tea juice fully leaching. When cooking, you can also add seasonings by mixing the drinks. After stopping the fire and filtering the tea, divide it and drink it hot. Its aroma is pure and distant, with a strong and slightly astringent taste, with a significant sweetness, a red and yellow soup color, and the leaves are old, tender and evenly symmetrical. The production technology of Anhua flower brick tea has gone through two stages: family inheritance and industry collective inheritance. From the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, using human, animal power or hydraulic pressure to make tea bricks, to now, fully mechanized production has been achieved. Anhua flower brick tea has a unique production process, has a large aging and transformation space and collection value, and has profound tea culture connotation.

It is a typical representative of Anhua black tea and is mainly circulated in Anhua County, Hunan Province. \n\n\n\n\nAnhua black tea was mostly tributed by the imperial court. In the fifth year of Xining in the Song Dynasty (1072), Anhua opened a tea farm and made tea to pay tribute, which was called \"Sibao Gong Tea\". During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, Anhua Jiangnan Dehe Tea Store used the local black hair tea with tender local raw materials to process it as loose tea, which was divided into seven types: bud tips, white hair tips, Tianjian, Gongjian, Township tips, Shengjian, and bundled tips. As valuable gifts, especially the \"three tips\" of Tianjian, Gongjian and Shengjian. Tianjian uses first-level black tea as the main ingredients and a small amount of second-level upgraded tea is added. The tribute tea is mainly composed of second-grade black tea, with a small amount of raw materials for first-grade decline and third-grade improvement. The raw tea used in raw tips is relatively coarse and old, most of which are flakes and contain more stems. Tianjian tea is purely handmade, divided into two stages: black tea making and Tianjian tea making. Black tea is made from fresh leaves with one bud, one leaf to one bud, four leaf or a relatively tender degree of pair of leaves, and is made by finishing, rolling, pile-up fermenting, first drying, and until the seven-star stove is dry. Tianjian tea processing is divided into three major processes: screening, even stacking and construction. The black tea is made by round sieve, air selection and picking. The semi-finished tea embryos are stacked in accordance with the quality standards to make their quality even. Then, Tianjian tea is made. The production of Tianjian tea is to weigh a certain weight of tea, soften it by steaming and put it into a bamboo basket to make it pressed. The micro-pressed acquired Tianjian tea is naturally cooled and dried in the bamboo strip packaging, and the moisture content is less than 12% before it leaves the factory. The bamboo basket packaging is good in breathability, which is conducive to the oxidation and ripening of Tianjian tea, removing odors, and maintaining the aging fragrance of the tea. \n\n\n\n\nAnhua Tianjian tea production technology has developed well in productive protection. In ancient times, Tianjian Tea gave noble gifts to tea merchants from officials, wealthy businessmen, relatives and friends. During the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty (around 1825), it was listed as a tribute and was exclusively for royal drinking. It has now become a fashionable drink for the wealthy people in the south. This tea can be made or brewed, which is suitable for both clean drinks and milk tea. Especially in teahouses in the south, brewing tea pots and cold drink tea at home, are all good choices. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Hunan Baishaxi Tea Factory Co., Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXiao Yiping\n\n(February 1964—) Male, Han nationality, from Xiaoyan Town, Anhua County, Hunan Province, senior agronomist, senior tea evaluator, member of the Border Tea Sales Working Group of the National Standardization Technical Committee, member of the National Tea Standardization Technical Committee, and representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of black tea production skills (Anhua Tianjian Tea Production Technology). \n\nHe was born in Baishaxi.

The craft mat can also weave patterns such as herringbone patterns, ten thousand characters grids, phoenix tail pictures, plum blossom scenes, chain locks, as well as flowers, birds, insects and fish, figures, landscapes, calligraphy and painting. Generally, 12 bamboo strips can be weaved per inch in width, and up to 36 fine craft mats. The edge of the brake is an important process in the later stage of making water bamboo mats. It must be neat and evenly shaped without revealing the marks of the bamboo head. Water bamboo mats can generally be used for 30 years, and the color will gradually turn red and the heat dissipation performance will become better and better. \n\n\n\n\nThe production skills of Yiyang water bamboo mats are mainly based on family traditions and master-apprentice heritage.

Chenhe puppet show entered its heyday in the late Qing Dynasty. It was an artistic form that integrates religious culture, folk skills and opera art, and uses the art of stick-headed puppets as the main expression form. The performance group of Chenhe puppet show is called \"Naotai Ban\", which is one of the three performance forms of Chenhe's high-alloon \"Haotai\" (stage singing), \"Naotai\" (puppet singing), and \"Enjoy the drum\" (sitting and singing). The short-dai team that sings the Chenhe puppet show usually consists of seven to nine people. It is light and simple to wear and cheaply charge, which is very suitable for the needs of the people in the mountainous areas. Chenzhou puppets are puppets with stick heads, which consist of four parts: puppet head, puppet body, raising pole and hand sign. The puppet head has four shapes: Sheng, Dan, Jing and Chou. The biggest feature of puppet show performance is \"there is a mouth but a mouth but a mouth but a mouth but a person is like a person who is not a person who dances with others.\" The repertoire sung by Chenhe puppet show is exactly the same as the repertoire sung by Chenhe opera stage. The most common repertoire is the Liantai play \"Xiangshan\", which is a story of Guanyin's enlightenment. Generally, the repertoire performed by the short-dai team during the day must be \"Xiangshan\", which is called \"Main Opera\". The repertoire performed at night is called \"Flower Opera\", which can be sung any repertoire of Chenhe. The inheritance methods of Chenhe puppet show are generally three types: family inheritance, master-apprentice inheritance, and school teaching inheritance. Chenhe puppet show maintains close relationship with folk religion and customs, integrates folk prayers and artistic activities. It is a rare drama in China that maintains the original ecological performance, and is of great significance to studying the generation and development of Chinese folk opera.

Lanxi Mountain Songs gradually evolved from the labor romance created by local ancestors during water fishing and swamp farming. Depending on the degree of labor heavy work and different labor methods, folk songs naturally produce different rhythms and tones. Lanxi folk songs can be divided into high-control, flat cavity, and low cavity according to the voice cavity. The flat cavity can also be divided into high-flat cavity and low-flat cavity. According to the plate type, it can be roughly divided into fast board, flat board (middle board) and slow board, and the water board and number board are divided according to the needs of the lyrics. The more labor-intensive the more you use the higher the accent, the more you use falsetto. Quick-pin is generally sung in high-sounding accents. There are the most lyrics and music used on flat panels, and there are many people singing. The rhythm is usually 42 beats, and the tone is mostly flat singing. The characteristic of slow-plate is that it is relatively free to perform and the rhythm is often 4 and 4 beats. The flowing water board is also called \"scattered board\", which belongs to a single beat. Lanxi mountain songs have rich musical cards, which can be divided into four types: owl mountain songs, field songs, housework mountain songs and minor mountain songs. The singing format is flexible, with both the singing style of drama and the singing style of singing and dancing. The singing methods include solo, duet, one-leading and multi-vocal chorus, etc. His representative works \"Ten Fleece\" and other works were included in \"Chinese Folk Songs Collection·Yiyang County Volume\". Lanxi mountain songs have either cultivated or promoted the birth and development of art forms such as flower drums, flower drum operas and musicals in Yiyang.

    "description-en": "The statue of the plum king is circulated in the Meishan Cultural Center areas such as Anhua County, Xinhua County, Lianyuan City, Hunan Province. During the late Tang Dynasty, Anhua, Xinhua and other counties were collectively known as Meishan, and Miao and Yao ethnic groups lived in it. In 886 AD, the local people supported Han people to support Hanyang as king, and the capital was set up in Meicheng, which people called it \"Plum King\" or \"Plum King\". Legend has it that Fu Hanyang was from Hanyang, and was originally a minister of the Later Zhou Dynasty. Because Zhao Kuangyin pursued him, he \"didn't hide in Meishan.\" In order to help Miao and Yao survive, he bravely shouldered the heavy responsibilities and led Meishan Yao Miao to establish a defense team. He claimed to have three thousand bee soldiers and three thousand snake soldiers. He practiced martial arts every day and often won surprises when fighting against the enemy. The \"Battle of Nine Passes and Eighteen Locks\" destroyed Wang Tong's entire army. The Plum King cares about people's livelihood. He established letter contacts with officials and merchants from neighboring counties, introduced cloth and salt to ensure civil use; he made the \"five care and one\" regulations for the elderly orphans, that is, five households raise one person, and they will be responsible for their birth, raising, raising, and burying. He exempted Miao and Yao from heavy taxes and service, reducing the burden on ethnic minorities economically. In the second year of Taiping Xingguo in the Song Dynasty, the imperial court sent troops to encircle Meishan, and King Mei died heroically. The son of the Han people shed his last drop of blood to protect the survival of ethnic minorities. According to folk legend, after the death of the Mei King, he became a god and ascended to heaven. People respected the King of Plum as a god, and the shrines of each family said \"Plum City Helps the Lord of Blessings\" or \"Plum City Good Deeds the Lord of Blessings\" and invited the King of Plum City to the shrine for a family sacrifice. The people on the borders of Anhua, Ningxiang and Taojiang counties go to Xinqiao Temple to Chongfuwang Temple every year on the 11th of the first lunar month to celebrate the birthday of the plum king. The legend about the plum king has been passed down from generation to generation. In order to express his commemoration and love for him, the Miao Yao people named the mountain where they fought \"Fuwang Mountain\", the bridge where the battle was located \"Fuwang Bridge\", and built more than 10 Fuwang Temples. Many people named their sons \"Fuyou\", \"Fubao\" and \"Fuji\". The legend of the Prince of Mei mainly includes the morality of the Prince of Mei as heavy as a mountain, caring for people's livelihood, showing off the dead, protecting the people, etc. Due to historical events, it has been continuously developed through the rendering of mysterious folk colors, which has led to the folk culture related to the worship of gods. For thousands of years, the legend of the Prince of Mei has been widely circulated in the Meishan area through various sacrificial rituals and word-of-mouth folk legends. The legend of the Prince of Mei has led the Miao and Yao people to oppose the suppression and blockade of the imperial court, guarding the land and protecting the people, and fighting the enemy's sacrifice, and reflecting the strong spirit of national unity and mutual assistance, which can be regarded as a hymn for the unity and mutual assistance of the Han, Miao and Yao people in history.

It is mainly circulated in Anhua County, Hunan Province and radiates to surrounding counties and cities. \n\nMeishan was vast in ancient times.

It connects to Tan in the east and Shao in the south; it connects to Chen in the west, and to tripod in the north.\" According to local folk legends, the representative double goose window flowers in Meishan paper-cut can be traced back to the unique wedding custom of using geese as a hijab when Meishan was stationed in Meishan in the early Western Han Dynasty. In the \"Anhua County Chronicles\" of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty, there are customs records such as \"using paper money to hang graves on Qingming Festival\", \"burning paper clothes, paper money, and money during the Zhongyuan Festival... chiseling paper wallets to seal and burn them\", and \"removing stickers to the door\". Such paper-cutting customs have been preserved intact locally and have a broad mass base. Meishan paper cutting can be found in two types: flower cutting and flower filing. The flower-cutting style is childish and simple, and the pattern of filed flowers is complex and exquisite, with various forms such as flat, three-dimensional, monochrome, color set, and color addition. Use scissors to cut local soil to make red paper, which can be cut 4-6 layers at a time.

The materials for flower filing tools include camphor wood pads, files, various colored flower papers, etc., which can reach more than 20 layers at a time.

The production of Anhua Qianliang Tea is divided into two stages: black tea making and deep processing. The production of black tea includes five processes: finishing, rolling, pile-up, re-kneading, and baking. The deep processing process is much more complicated, including screening, mixing, softening, basket loading, pressing, clamping, locking, cooling, drying and other links. After 55 days of sun and night dew, it is made into a finished black tea product.\n\n\n\n\nRelated inheritors\n\n\n\n\nLi Shengfu, Male, Han nationality, Traditional skills, VIII-152, Black tea making skills (Thousand-two tea making skills) Anhua County, Hunan Province"

It is the charm of this water town and country that constitutes the unique geographical environment for the growth and inheritance of folk culture. The unique folk dance - the Earth Flower Drum was derived from this land.\n　　\n\nNanxian Dihuagu originated in the third year of Jiaqing in the Qing Dynasty (1796). It evolved based on folk folk songs, minor tunes and labor romances. With its simple and rough movements, bright and high-pitched music, lively and free performance, rich atmosphere of life and unique artistic style, it is deeply rooted in the people. The local flower drum in Nanxian has many forms of expression, such as pair of flower drums, bamboo horse flower drums, and dragon flower drums. The double-colored flower drum is also called \"single flower drum\". Once the two men dress up, they will play \"condoms\" and \"turn the nest\" according to the meaning of \"Dec-Yue Lang\", \"Mopping the floor stool\", \"October sister\", \"Picking tea\", \"Flower arrangement\", \"Fan tune\", and \"Sending wealth song\". They are good at using fans and handkerchiefs to express the emotions and personalities of characters. The bamboo horse earthen flower drum is a form of performance that evolved on the basis of the pair earthen flower drum. The protagonist is added to the samurai, holding a horse whip, and covering various colors of fabrics or paper bamboo horses on the shoulders or waist. It is interspersed with the earthen flower drums and the Dan. Some are also equipped with somersaults. The scene is majestic and the performance is delicate. The performance program of the flower drum and dan and ugliness in the dragon are slightly different from the first two forms. There is \"sending wealth\" when entering the door, and \"saying east when going out\", and using \"playing beads\", \"lifting the well\", \"plate board\", \"butterfly\" and \"sleeping arhat\" or posing the words \"floor harvest\" to create a festive and auspicious atmosphere.\n　　\n\n\n\n\nNanxian Dihuagu passed through the enlightenment period of the Qing Dynasty, the development period after the founding of New China and the heyday after the 1980s, which played a crucial role in the enlightenment period of Hunan Huagu Opera. With the rapid changes in the economy and society, the cultural ecology has undergone drastic changes. The flower drums in Nanxian County have lost their past glory and are on the verge of being lost, and need emergency rescue and protection.\n　　"

    "description-en": "The work \"Crane\" by Palm Leaf\n\n\n\n\nChangsha Palm Leaf Weaving is a craft made from the leaves of palm trees in the south as raw materials, and is circulated in Changsha City, Hunan Province and other places. \n\n\n\n\nChinese palm weaving has a long history and is mainly divided into two categories: daily necessities, palm weaving and arts, crafts, palm weaving. Palm weavings for daily necessities such as straw raincoats made by southern farmers with palm leaf silk and brown ropes, palm leaf fans for southerners to cool off in summer, etc.; arts and crafts palm weaving is Changsha palm leaf weaving. During the Republic of China, people could see people weaving dragonflies, grasshoppers and other insects using palm leaves to make various types of insects, which were sold on the streets. Changsha palm leaf weaving is divided into four categories: pure brown core braided products, new palm leaf, old palm leaf braided products, and mixed brown core with new and old palm leaf braided products, and works of different styles are weaved according to different color effects. In early April of each year, artists start collecting fresh brown leaves, fold them according to the patterns, and then put them in a boiling pot and cook until they turn yellow, and after sun and night dew, they are completely dry and white. In this way, the brown leaves will not deform and can be stored for more than ten years. When weaving, the image is formed by inserting and tying the structure. The method of braiding is to knit a workpiece according to the design requirements, shape the workpiece according to needs, form a component, and then combine it into an object by component. Using palm blades to lock and fold shape is the basic method of palm weaving. The main themes include dragonflies, grasshoppers, frogs, shrimps, centipedes, turtles, snakes, goldfish, chickens, cranes, peacocks, phoenixes and other insects, including \"single belly\" and \"double belly\". After weaving, add-ons are used as small embellishments, and mandarin duck beans (red beans) are used as eyes, which is called the \"finishing touch\". The body and claws of small animals are made of thin iron wire as skeletons. Changsha palm leaf weaving uses old and new palm leaves to express the color of the work, and uses palm leaves of different depths to weave various parts, so that the work is bright and dark and has clear layers. \n\n\n\n\nChangsha palm leaf weaving has rich themes, diverse techniques, realistic shapes and beautiful shapes. It has high artistic appreciation and collection value and is known as \"the best in Jiangnan\". \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Changsha Tianxin District Cultural Center\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nWang Wending (first from right) exchange teaching\n\n\n\n\nWang Wending\n\n(September 1952 -) Female, Han nationality, from Hengshan County, Hunan Province, a master of Chinese arts and crafts, and a representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of Palm Weaving (Changsha Palm Leaf Weaving). \n\nAt the age of 14, she learned palm weaving skills with her brother Wang Wengu. For many years, I have been devoted to studying the creation of palm weaving, actively innovating in the selection of materials, techniques, shapes, preservation, etc., and creating the \"double belly\" weaving method. This technique elevates traditional folk skills to the level of overall shape and is original. His works have won the highest awards in Hunan Folk Arts and Crafts Competition, Hunan Tourism Products Expo and other activities. They have been included in monographs or albums such as \"Hunan Folk Art Shi Zero\", \"Huxiang Miscellaneous Arts\", and \"Changsha Palm Edition\", and have been selected into the nine-year compulsory education \"Art\" textbook. In 1973, he began to teach his disciples in the Chating Commune of Changsha County, Changsha Arts and Crafts Company, Changsha Yuelu Park and other places. So far, a large number of palm-woven inheritors and enthusiasts have been trained."

    "description": "\n\n文震坤剪纸作品\n\n\n\n\n望城民间剪纸流传于湖南省长沙市望城区。 \n\n\n\n\n望城民间剪纸何时起源已不可考，清同治《长沙县志》可见相关记载，说明望城境域的民间剪纸至迟在清代早期就已广泛流传。望城民间剪纸以湘江为界，分河西、河东两大风格。河西的剪纸与凿花皆兼，先打画稿，讲究构图的平衡，多人物剪纸，图案丰满，对比鲜明，线条流畅，动态感强，富有装饰图案美。河东剪纸不打画稿，信手剪来，具有简炼朴实、干净洒脱、对称均匀的特点，作品生动传神，追求意境。望城民间剪纸品种繁多，可以分为节庆活动、人生礼仪、禳灾占卜、时令物候、超度祭祀、游艺装饰、绣花样稿等七个大类。这些品类的剪纸统称剪纸，但有的品类有特殊的名称，如结婚办喜事贴在窗户上的剪纸有个专门名字叫“喜期窗花”，举行禳灾占卜活动贴在“镜门”上的人物剪纸称为“梅山纸菩萨”，装饰在祭祀用品上的凿花则称为“格子”或“格子花”。综合折剪是望城民间剪纸独有的技艺和风格特征。它集剪、刻、凿、撕、火镂等各种方法于一体；粗犷、细腻，写实、写意等各种风格手法皆具，吉祥图形剪纸、祭祀剪纸、游艺装饰剪纸等各种品种类别剪纸杂陈。 \n\n\n\n\n望城民间剪纸具有浓郁的生活气息和丰富的民俗文化内涵，具有典型的湘中梅山地域文化特征，如巫觋“使法”用的“替身娃娃”和“棕傩面”，以及用于求雨、驱除虫害等禳灾活动的大鹏金翅鸟、雷公、电母等剪纸图形。这些剪纸都是人类幼年“万物有灵”的原始宗教与信仰的反映，是难得的、仅存的“活化石”。而其独特的综合折剪手法和它所表现出的艺术特征不但具有进一步研究的价值，也丰富了剪纸的创作手法和表现形式。望城剪纸的传承方式主要是师徒传承，目前还采取进校园的方式进行教学传承。 \n\n\n\n\n项目保护单位：长沙市望城区文化馆\n\n\n\n\n传承人：\n\n\n\n\n秦石蛟 \n\n（1938年3月—）男，汉族，湖南省长沙市望城区白箬铺镇人，副研究馆员，中国民间文艺家协会会员，中国工艺美术协会会员，中华文化促进会剪纸艺术委员会副主任，湖南省剪纸研究会会长，民间剪纸的省级非物质文化遗产代表性传承人。 \n\n他自幼随母亲文震坤学习剪纸。在多年的剪纸生涯中，总结和发展了望城民间综合折剪技艺，创造了“特技折剪”，破解了逆向对称图形、同向二方连续图形折剪的难题。1984年应邀赴日本作剪纸艺术表演，被媒体赞誉为“神剪”。他的剪纸作品多次获全国剪纸竞赛金奖，并被国家博物馆收藏。他发表了《剪纸产生的原始动机》等80多篇专业论文，出版了《民间剪纸图形》等30多部专著，获颁中国民间工艺、中华剪纸艺术“终身成就奖”。",

    "description-en": "Wen Zhenkun's paper-cut works\n\n\n\n\nThe folk paper-cuts in Wangcheng are circulated in Wangcheng District, Changsha City, Hunan Province. \n\n\n\n\nWhen the origin of the folk paper-cut in Wangcheng is no longer verified. The relevant records can be seen in the \"Changsha County Chronicle\" of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty, indicating that the folk paper-cut in Wangcheng area was widely circulated in the early Qing Dynasty at the latest. The folk paper-cutting in Wangcheng is bounded by Xiangjiang River and is divided into two major styles: Hexi and Hedong. Hexi's paper-cutting and flower-cutting are both good. First, draw the drawing, pay attention to the balance of composition, and many characters have paper-cutting, full patterns, bright contrast, smooth lines, strong dynamic sense, and full of decorative patterns. Hedong paper-cutting without drawings, but free and easy, symmetrical and uniform. The works are vivid and vivid, and pursue artistic conception. There are many types of folk paper-cuts in Wangcheng, which can be divided into seven categories: festival activities, life etiquette, disaster prevention and divination, seasonal phenology, salvation sacrifice, entertainment decoration, and embroidery patterns. Paper-cutting in these categories is collectively called paper-cutting, but some categories have special names. For example, the paper-cutting on the windows when getting married and having weddings has a special name called \"Xiqi Window Flowers\". The paper-cutting of characters posted on the \"mirror door\" for disaster prevention and divination activities is called \"Meishan Paper Bodhisattva\", and the chiseled flowers decorated on sacrificial supplies are called \"plaids\" or \"plaids\". Comprehensive folding cuts are the unique skills and style characteristics of Wangcheng folk paper cutting. It integrates various methods such as cutting, engraving, chiseling, tearing, and fire engraving; it is rough, delicate, realistic, freehand and other styles and techniques, including auspicious graphic paper cutting, sacrificial paper cutting, amusement decoration paper cutting and other various types of paper cutting and miscellaneous paper cutting. \n\n\n\n\nThe folk paper-cuts in Wangcheng have a strong atmosphere of life and rich folk cultural connotations, and have typical regional cultural characteristics of Meishan in central Hunan, such as the \"substitute dolls\" and \"brown Nuo masks\" used in \"making the law\" of witches, as well as paper-cut graphics such as the Golden-winged birds, Thunderbolt, and Electric Mother used to ward off disasters such as rain and pest removal. These paper-cuts are reflections of the primitive religion and belief of human beings in their childhood, and are rare and only remaining \"living fossils\". Its unique comprehensive folding and scissoring technique and the artistic characteristics it shows not only have the value of further research, but also enriches the creative techniques and expression forms of paper cutting. The inheritance method of Wangcheng paper cutting is mainly the inheritance of master and apprentice, and currently the teaching inheritance is adopted by entering the campus. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Changsha Wangcheng District Cultural Center\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nQin Shijiao\n\n(March 1938 -) Male, Han nationality, from Bairuopu Town, Wangcheng District, Changsha City, Hunan Province, associate research librarian, member of the China Folk Artists Association, member of the China Arts and Crafts Association, deputy director of the Paper-Cutting Art Committee of the Chinese Culture Promotion Association, president of the Hunan Paper-Cutting Research Association, and representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of folk paper-cutting. \n\nHe studied paper cutting with his mother Wen Zhenkun since childhood. In his many years of paper cutting career, he summarized and developed the comprehensive folding and shearing skills of Wangcheng folk, created \"special folding and shearing\", and solved the problem of folding and shearing in reverse symmetrical graphics and two-sided continuous graphics in the same direction. In 1984, he was invited to Japan to perform paper-cutting art performances and was praised by the media as \"Divine Scissors\". His paper-cutting works have won the gold medal in the national paper-cutting competition many times and have been collected by the National Museum. He has published more than 80 professional papers, including \"The Original Motivation of Paper Cutting\", published more than 30 monographs, including \"Folk Paper Cutting Graphics\", and won the \"Lifetime Achievement Award\" for Chinese Folk Crafts and Chinese Paper Cutting Art."

    "description-en": "Taogong Temple Fair Changsha Taogong Temple Fair was a temple fair formed based on Taogong Temple. It is also one of the widely influential temple fairs in Hunan. It is circulated in Langli Town, Changsha County, Hunan Province. The Taogong Temple was built in the fourth year of Tianjian, Liang Dynasty (505 AD) in the Southern Dynasties. It was built by local people to admire the reputation of Tao Dan and Taoyuan. Tao Dan and Tao Xuan were uncles and nephews. They abandoned their family and practiced Taoism, built a hut and practiced in Langli Linxiang Mountain. Later, they turned into immortals and became physical Bodhisattvas who compassionate the people's livelihood and responded to their requests. Taogong Temple is famous all over the world. It was built during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty and the Guangxu period, forming today's building scale. The sacrifices of folk and government officials in all dynasties have been effective, leaving behind many stories and legends. The temple retains poems, couplets and plaques written by famous scholars of various dynasties. On the birthdays of the two Tao Gong Bodhisattvas on the thirteenth day of the first lunar month and the seventeenth day of the eighth month of the lunar month, good men and women will hold a grand temple fair to celebrate the birthday of Tao Gong Bodhisattvas. There were thousands of pilgrims from Sichuan, Hubei, Henan, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Guangxi and other places who came to the temple fair and worship. They were extremely pious to Tao Gong Bodhisattva and worshipped them in the form of \"Food Fragrance\" (hanging the small incense burner under the skin of the elbow with a thread) and worshipped them. Taoist priest of Tao Gong Temple invited the tablets of Fuyou Zhaoxian Tao Gong, Fuyou Lingying Tao Gong, Yunyin Biohua Du Gong, and Yunyin Biohua Du Gong to hold an incense ceremony. There are many good shows in the ancient theater in the temple. Celebrities such as Hunan opera and Peking opera in Changsha City are performed on stage, performing them all day and night. In the temple, we played dragons, lion dances, arhat dances, bamboo lanterns, etc., and gathered all kinds of arts to drive the development of local opera and folk art. During the temple fair, merchants gathered and economic and trade flourished, which naturally promoted the economic prosperity around Taogong Temple. Due to the needs of temple fairs, people built huts and formed a market, and gradually formed today's Langli Town. There is a folk song saying: \"There is no field on Langli Street, and you can eat it for one year for two years.\" Nowadays, the form of the Taogong Temple Fair in Changsha is becoming more and more abundant. Lion and dragon dance performances, experience folk culture, and taste authentic food have become a folk festival in Changsha City with a great influence.

    "description-en": "Jiang's technique to correct the bone\n\n\n\n\nJiang's bone correction technique is a traditional Chinese medicine bone correction therapy inherited by the Jiang family in Liuyang, and is circulated in Liuyang City, Hunan Province. \n\n\n\n\nJiang's bone correction technique originated in the late Qing Dynasty and was created by Jiang Piyou, the first generation inheritor. After more than a hundred years of inheritance and practice by four generations of the family, a compatible and distinctive bone correction medical system has been formed, mainly manifested in bone correction theory and bone correction technology. In terms of bone correction theory, the theory of qi, blood and semen distribution represented by Jiang Lin advocates the use of holistic syndrome differentiation and dynamic balance as the Jiang's characteristic theoretical system, and follows the \"dialectical concept\" and \"holistic concept\" of traditional Chinese medicine; in terms of bone correction technology, first, in bone correction therapy, manual bone correction is its technical core, following the eight methods of bone correction, \"touching, connecting, ending, lifting, pushing, holding, pressing, and massage\" bone correction. With folding top as the basic therapy, and \"extraction\" as the main principle, its manual reduction and rehabilitation techniques include distinctive manual reduction, individualized small splint fixing, as well as dynamic and self-made bamboo bow traction, ancestral internal and external medicines, and dynamic and static rehabilitation treatment methods. Second, in terms of equipment use, many unique bone-regulating equipment have been created, such as the use of fir bark and bamboo bow. Homemade Jiang's orthopedic surgical medicine, oral medicine wine and pills have also obtained national invention patent certificates. Third, in the inheritance of skills, we pay attention to the traditional teaching of teachers, and emphasize the practice of inheritors' boy skills, and practice martial arts to strengthen medical skills. The bone correction technique focuses on stability, accuracy, speed and speed. The so-called \"the method makes people suddenly unaware of it, and the patient knows that the pain and bones have been combined.\" Therefore, in the traditional Chinese medicine bone correction school, Jiang's bone correction technique has the advantages of less pain, quick healing, few complications and secondary diseases, and low cost. Fourth, in keeping pace with the times, Jiang's Orthopedics is based on organically combining traditional techniques with various external fixation equipment, and constantly overcoming surgical treatment difficulties such as modern compound injuries. It also combines traditional traditional Chinese medicine treatment models with modern Western medical science and technology, and innovatively uses minimally invasive bone correction techniques, so that the traditional Chinese medicine bone injury skills can keep pace with the times and better benefit society. \n\n\n\n\nThe traditional Chinese medicine bone correction diagnosis and treatment represented by Jiang's bone correction surgery is a treasure of traditional Chinese medicine culture. Jiang's bone correction technique advocates traditional Chinese medicine for diagnosis and treatment and holistic concepts. Using Chinese medicine to apply internally and externally can well cooperate with the treatment of fractures and promote its healing. It meets the requirements of the country to promote and develop traditional Chinese medicine culture and is conducive to the inheritance and promotion of China's excellent traditional culture. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Liuyang Orthopedic Hospital\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nJiang Lin diagnoses and treats patients\n\n\n\n\nJiang Lin\n\n(September 1952 -) Male, Han nationality, from Shegang Town, Liuyang City, Hunan Province, chief physician of the Department of Orthopedics of Traditional Chinese Medicine, famous Chinese medicine doctor in Changsha City, expert of special government allowances from the State Council, and representative inheritor of provincial intangible cultural heritage of traditional Chinese medicine oral correction therapy (Jiang's bone correction technique). \n\nHe came from a family of bone injuries. He worked with his father Jiang Shuwu in clinical bone injuries treatment with his father Jiang Shuwu at the age of 15. Later, he went to Hunan College of Traditional Chinese Medicine to further study and obtained a bachelor's degree. Continuously study and study, we have collected the secrets of the three generations of ancestral treatment and bone training and the essence of medical theory, and creatively inherited the ancestral bone correction and healing techniques. According to the concept of distinguishing symptoms and treating qi, blood and semen distribution in traditional Chinese medicine, Jiang's academic system of bone correction was constructed; according to the treatment principle of combining movement and stillness of bone injuries in traditional Chinese medicine, percutaneous needle threading and bamboo bow traction method were invented; for the healing treatment of limb fracture deformities, the principle of bone correction was proposed: \"firm the first to be correct, break and return to the right\" was proposed. In 1986, he was awarded the title of National Advanced Worker in Health Civilization and was identified as a famous rural traditional Chinese medicine doctor in Hunan Province by the Hunan Provincial Department of Health in 2004. Actively carry out academic exchanges and publish the book \"The Essence of Jianglin Medical Cases\", which includes three patented products: Danshao Pills, Huoxue Treatment San, and Healing Medicinal Solution.

    "description-en": "Mingde Dongjing Middle School Dragon Team Style Dongjing Dragon Dance is a folk New Year celebration and entertainment festival event, mainly circulated in Dongjing Town, Yuhua District, Changsha City, Hunan Province. There are many types of dragon dances in Dongjing, which are roughly divided into \"Bulong\", \"Three-section Dragon\", \"Human Dragon\", and \"Long Dragon\". Among them: \"Bron\" is widely popular among the masses. The dragon head is small, divided into 9 sections and 11 sections. The main dance methods are: tying the buttons, posing patterns, typing, etc.; \"Human Dragon\" is a large-scale bare-hand dance. This \"Human Dragon\" does not use any props and is composed of adults and children's bare hands. The movements are mainly \"S\"-shaped walking and ups and downs; \"Long Dragon\" is also known as \"Swing Dragon\", with a large dragon head, thick dragon body, and generally 13 to 15 long legs. It is not suitable for large dances, mainly to show the momentum of the dragon; the performance of \"Three-Chapter Dragon\" mainly involves the cooperation of dragon dancers on the platform, with few people and simple movements. Dongjing Longwu’s props are exquisitely made. The dragon head and tail are usually made of bamboo strips, coated with varnish, and pasted with colorful paper (thick) to make the dragon body colorful, festive and prosperous, with scales or wavy patterns on it. The traditional costumes of dragon dancers generally use colored cloth edgings, leggings, cloth socks and straw sandals, and a triangular scarf to tie them to the head. The costumes are now more fashionable, with bright colors, beautiful and generous, and easy to dance. The dragon dance instruments generally use folk percussion instruments plus suona. The soundtrack is some familiar folk music and minor tunes such as \"The Desperate Order\", \"Ten Lanterns\", and \"Wanglang\". Now it also plays some cheerful, lively and festive modern music. The dragon dance team is divided into the leading team, the dragon team and the guard team. Dragon dance generally uses magpies, running (walking) smoothing, running and jumping steps, etc. The Dongjing dragon dance was passed down from generation to generation by local farmers, and has better preserved the traditional artistic style of folk dragon dance in Changsha. Its inheritance is mainly based on master-apprentice inheritance. In 2012, Mingde Dongjing Middle School began to adopt teaching methods to inherit Dongjing dragon dance, and often organized dragon dance teams to perform in festivals, celebrations and entertainment activities in the local and even in Changsha area, enriching the cultural life of the general public and contributing to the inheritance and development of Dongjing dragon dance.

Some large temple fairs have already been of considerable scale in the Tang Dynasty and are still passed down and have a wide influence. All kinds of temple fairs have their own scheduled meetings, most of which are a traditional lunar festival or a anniversary of religious and folk beliefs. The temple fair is characterized by centralization, groupness and fixedness. During the temple fair, various folk activities and technical trade activities can be fully displayed in public, and the content of the activities is rich and colorful. The welcoming ceremony is also a form of the temple fair. In the Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions of my country, as well as in Taiwan, traditional temple fairs are introduced from the mainland and are constantly connected with the mother body.

During the Ming Dynasty, hundreds of blacksmiths who were both workers and farmers in the Changsha area of ​​Laodao River produced scissors, kitchen knives and razors. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, Dong Yanzhang, a blacksmith in Beishan, Dongxiang, Changsha, opened a \"Dong Tongxing\" knife and scissor shop at the entrance of the college street, and hired personnel to use autocratic razors and scissors to gradually form famous brands. The varieties of knife and scissors produced by Laodaohe include kitchen knives, razors, pharmaceutical knives, leather knives, rubber knives, food knives, civilian knives, children's shoe knives, orange knives, clothing knives, sand knives, etc., and are known as the \"king of steel and fire\" in the industry. The scissors have clear steel, sharp edges, pure steel and fire, easy to balance opening and closing, straight blades, flat heads, flat tips, and symmetrical scissors. Scissors can cut various soft materials such as cotton, wool, silk, hemp, silk, etc. The hardness of the knife edge is 50-58 degrees (Hrc). There is no tick or bite on the 5 layers of cloth. The silk is cut by a thin silk knife, without silk. The knife has a sharp edge, a flat and smooth surface, and a smooth and straight handle. The kitchen knife can be cut forward and chopped backward, with a hardness of 52-63 degrees. The chopping is mainly chopped ribs and bamboo chopsticks, which can achieve the requirement of not collapsing or rolling; cutting meat and ginger can achieve the requirement of cutting meat over the tendons and cutting ginger without leaving any shreds. The production skills of the knife and scissors are completed by hand and simple tools. Since its development, there are more than 30 processes from raw material processing to finished products, which are completed by manual and semi-mechanical processing. The material has been improved from the original simple combination of iron and steel to modern stainless steel and alloy steel. The production skills of the sword and scissors are all passed down from generation to generation by master and apprentice. The production technology is difficult, the production process is complex, and the learning time is long. It not only depends on words and deeds between master and apprentice, but also on understanding and long-term practice.

It is circulated in Tangshi Village, Laoliangcang Town, Ningxiang, Hunan Province, and radiates to the Maple Bridge and Liusha River areas. Tang City is a thousand-year-old ancient town, and gold and silver jewelry processing is a local traditional industry, which initially started with carving wooden seals. The late Qing Dynasty was a period of rapid development of the hand-processed gold and silver jewelry industry, with many silver workshops and skilled artists emerging. The family-style Shenjia Yinfang \"Heyixing\" was the most famous during the Guangxu period. The main processes of gold and silver jewelry processing in Tang City include sawing, tar, filing, grinding, high-temperature melting, forging, engraving, polishing, etc., which are fast, accurate and precise. Processing tools include welding guns, sludge, agate knife, hammer, pliers, sludge, polishing machine, tiger bench, leather tiger, blower, etc., which are simple and easy to carry and can work anytime and anywhere. His works are mostly gold and silver jewelry such as rings, bracelets, necklaces, earrings. Before the appearance of molds, artists mainly used melting and forging jewelry. The jewelry style was entirely controlled by craftsmen's heart, and they mostly processed small rings, earrings, and earrings, with different sizes and shapes. After the mold is produced, the artist uses the mold to process it, pour the molten material into the mold to form, and then weld and polish it according to the size of the fingers, greatly improving work efficiency. From 2010 to 2019, due to social development, technological progress, and the impact of e-commerce, the jewelry industry also experienced several reshuffles. Tang City people created jewelry brands such as \"Zhang Wanfu\" and \"Kelaidi\", and implemented franchise chain operations, and made the Ningxiang jewelry industry nationwide through online sales and company listing. The processing skills of gold and silver jewelry in Tang City are mainly based on family inheritance, including fathers passing through sons, uncles passing through nephews, brothers passing through brothers, and masters passing through brothers. Tangshi gold and silver jewelry processing has been passed down and developed from the initial polishing and carving of wood and stone seals, to metal melting, forging, carving and filing polishing, and then to mold making. From \"Zhangzike\" who travels the world with cloth bags and suitcases to jewelers covering the whole country with franchise stores, the success of business is not only due to seizing the development opportunities of the market, but also the result of Tangshi gold and silver jewelry processing craftsmen relying on their hard work, wisdom, and hard work.

Legend has it that the Holy Emperor of Nanyue, Shennong, comes to Yunyang Mountain, Chaling to escape the summer heat in June and July of the lunar calendar every year. Shennong and Shennong people came here to worship the sky and pray for prosperity and benefit the people, thus gradually forming the custom of \"June and July to Yunyang and August to Hengshan\". Therefore, on the 30th day of the fifth month and the 30th day of the lunar calendar every year, Yunyang Mountain holds a grand temple fair for welcoming and sending the car, and it is a traditional folk activity spontaneously formed by the general public. The Nanyue Palace in Yunyang Mountain, Chaling County was first built in Yonghui in the early Tang Dynasty and has a history of more than 1,300 years. During the incense period from the fifth to July of the lunar calendar every year, pilgrims from Youxian, Yanling, Anren, Jiangxi and Guangdong have worshipped the Holy Emperor of Nanyue to pray for blessings and blessings. Qifeng Dance is held on May 30th. The Qifeng Dance is first performed, and then the Taoist priests presided over the welcoming ceremony. There are procedures such as \"Fighting\", \"Treading Gang\", \"Treading Bagua Gang\", and inviting the Holy Emperor of Nanyue, and then the gate of Nanyue Palace is opened for pilgrims to worship. After the Dharma Assembly, there is a folk fire dragon dancing. After the welcoming event, there were still pilgrims staying in and outside the Taoist temple. Fortunately, they competed for the first incense stick in the early morning of June. During the temple fair, pilgrims prayed for blessings and wishes to \"burn incense\" in a constant stream. On the last night of the seventh month of the lunar calendar, the Taoist priests held a \"delivery\" Dharma ceremony, including \"stepping on the seven-star gang\", \"stepping on the eight-gua gang\", and other contents, as well as \"grass dragons travel to the mountains\" folk activities. Grass dragons travel to the mountains and ask the Holy Emperor of the Nanyue to go to Ziyun Peak to pray to Fengtai. Whenever he goes to one side, the dragon nods and prays for a good life in all directions in the coming year. The Nanyue Palace Temple Fair in Yunyang Mountain is mainly hosted by Taoist priests, with extensive participation from the masses, rich expressions and complete programming. It is a cultural phenomenon that integrates folk beliefs and Taoist beliefs. Taoism invited the Holy Emperor of Nanyue into the hall. Simple folk activities have enabled the Holy Emperor of Nanyue to return to the people from the Taoist temple. Especially in recent years, the temple fair has raised funds many times to restore the temple. The scale of the temple fair has become even more massive and spectacular.

Fireworks are also called \"fireworks\", \"fireworks\", \"fireworks\", and firecrackers are also called \"whip\", \"firecrackers\", \"fireworks\", \"fireworks\", and \"fireworks\". Fireworks production skills are mainly circulated in Liuyang City and Liling City, Hunan Province. The origin of the fireworks can be traced back to the Tang Dynasty. It is said that Li Ting was invented. His original intention was to drive away ghosts for Emperor Taizong of Tang Li Shimin, and to use the air waves and smoke generated during the explosion to dispel miasma and control the spread of civil disease epidemics. The earliest fireworks production areas in Liling are located in the area of ​​Mashi Village and Tongtang Village. During the Xianfeng and Tongzhi periods of the Qing Dynasty, the production areas expanded to Nanqiao, Baitutan, Xianshi, Pukou, and Wangfang, and were connected with Liuyang, Pingxiang and other areas, forming a concentrated production area. Traditional hand-made fireworks have 12 processes and 72 processes. Its main characteristics are sound, light, color, and air. Sound is an important indicator to measure product quality. Baiyao products have better sound effects than black medicine products; after the fireworks are set off, they produce red, yellow and green colors. The stronger the light, the better the product quality. After modern compounds are prepared with fireworks, many products are colorful when they are set off, adding auspicious colors to the happy atmosphere; the colors include the appearance of the product and the effect of the paper scattered after they are set off. When making, all red skins or red, green and yellow colored skins are used according to different varieties. When smoke is generated after they are set off, it emits a fragrant smell, which has the effect of removing stains, sterilizing and refreshing air. The effect of black medicine products is better than that of white medicine products. The inheritance methods of Liling’s fireworks production skills include master-apprentice inheritance and school teaching inheritance. Liling is the hometown of Master Li Ting, the ancestor of fireworks. It has strong local characteristics in the production and use of fireworks. It is mostly used for weddings and funerals, festivals, worshiping ancestors and worshiping gods, and welcoming guests and seeing off guests. People use this to express their joy and sorrow and use it as a gift. Liling Ceramic Fireworks Vocational and Technical School has opened a fireworks major to cultivate inheritors of fireworks technology, making this traditional production technology successor.

According to legend, in ancient times, Emperor Yan of the Chinese nation, Shennong, came to the south to inspect, taste grass and collect herbs, and cure diseases for the people. Unfortunately, he accidentally tasted poisonous weeds and died and was buried here. According to historical records, since the Han Dynasty, worshiping Emperor Yan has become a custom.\n　　\n\nEmperor Yan is a great figure and has always been greatly admired and sacrificed by the descendants of Yan and Huang from all dynasties.\n　　\n\n\n\n\nYanling County has a long history of culture and sacrifice methods include cultural sacrifices, material sacrifices, flame sacrifices, music sacrifices, dragon sacrifices, etc. There are two types of rituals: official rituals and folk rituals. Folk rituals continue for years, and official public rituals and rituals have continued since ancient times. According to historical records, grand festivals were \"one time in three years\" in the Song Dynasty, with no less than 15 times in the Ming Dynasty and as many as 38 times in the Qing Dynasty. In the long historical process, the \"Yan Emperor Mausoleum Festival\" has become a comprehensive cultural carrier covering multiple fields such as music, dance, and literature. Among them, nine dragons on the holy fire platform at the memorial site are radially arranged with the holy flint as the center, and flames are sprayed out from their mouths to ignite the Yan Emperor's holy fire at the top of the holy flint to commemorate the popularization of the use of fire by Yan Emperor Shennong; the \"human dragon\" performed at the scene without props reflects the concept that the Chinese are both descendants of the dragon and the person who passed on the dragon; in the square of the Shenlong Hall, the performance of five different colors of dragons, yellow, blue, black, white and red, in accordance with the direction of the \"five elements\", contains rich traditional cultural connotations. Since the reform and opening up, with the continuous strengthening of the influence of the Yan Emperor Mausoleum in the Chinese community, participating in the \"Yan Emperor Mausoleum Festival\" has become an important way for the descendants of Yan and Huang to find national identity, hope for national unity, and express patriotic feelings. In recent years, more than 100,000 overseas Chinese have come to the Yan Emperor Mausoleum to pay tribute every year.\n　　\n\n\n\n\nThe formation of Yan Emperor culture has gone through a process of blood, political and cultural identity. This recognition is still a solid spiritual bond to maintain national unity, national unity, and oppose division. Under the influence and influence of Yan Emperor culture, the excellent historical and cultural traditional virtues such as unity, independence, peace-loving, self-improvement, courage to contribute, and innovation formed still have a profound impact on today's Chinese people."

The ironwork in Youxian County sprouted in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, and was formed and spread because local pot-fired pot-making maker used the ironwork left when refining the pot. There are three steps of ironmaking in Youxian County: boiling, molten iron, and ironmaking. In the furnace, fill the iron into the simmer, place the simmer into the middle of the furnace, fill the simmer around it, and cover it with straw to cause the fire; molten iron is used to burn the flames quickly through a bellows, and wait until the combustion temperature in the furnace reaches about 1200℃-1500℃, and the crushed iron in the simmer is to turn into a solution; iron-splitting iron is to clamp the iron pliers and scoop out the iron water and quickly throw it into the air. There are two forms: bare-handed iron flower and wooden board iron flower. It takes only one person to complete it. Scoop the iron with one hand and throw it into the sky with the other hand. The iron with the iron is sparked with a height of 4 to 6 meters. Throwing it into the sky is like a scattering flowers of a goddess, and scattering it on the ground is like splashing gold and sprinkling silver. When making iron with wooden boards, the wooden boards are used to make shaped wooden boards. Generally, there are no less than two people in a group. One person scoops out the iron from the stove and throws it into the air. The other person quickly takes the iron thrown into the sky with the wooden board. The height is about 8 to 10 meters.

    "description-en": "The \"Huanglong Shedding Shell\" of Xingzi Lantern Dance Routine\n\n\n\n\nThe Xingzi Lantern in Liling City is a unique fire dragon dance. It originated in Tianxin Village and Dongxiang in Baitutan Town, Liling City, Hunan Province. It was later introduced to Liuyang City, Zhuzhou County, You County and Pingxiang in Jiangxi Province. \n\n\n\n\nThe Xingzi lamp originated from ancient times when people used nitrate, sulfur and charcoal to make \"twist\", clamped on wooden handles, ignite it, and ran back and forth in front of the house to disinfect the environment and detoxify the insects. A wise man was inspired to invent the art of Xingzi Lantern. Xingzi Lanterns can only be performed at night. A group of dancers held a wooden handle with a \"twist\" inserted into it. After igniting it, sparks flew everywhere, like the stars in the sky, so it was called \"Star Lantern\". Then, by following a certain routine, a fire dragon sometimes shrinks, sometimes stretches, sometimes jumps, sometimes flies, and sometimes dances, forming various bright shapes, which are dazzling. It has strong artistic expression and shocking power. Later, local folk artists continued to improve and standardize the props and formations of Xingzi Lanterns, gradually forming the complete structure of Xingzi Lanterns in Liling City today's folk dance. Xingzi Lanterns are dancers by 7 male actors, usually performed one week before and after the Mid-Autumn Festival every year, lasting half a month. The main contents of the performance include pulling one door, pulling two doors, pulling three doors, pulling four doors, Tai Chi diagram, pulling water from the barrel, pulling two-tone lotus, sitting on the lotus when the ants are out of the hole, rock eagle is drying out the armpit, yellow dog practices nest, hitting the ground rat, exploding the hoop, river red, and Taiping in the world. During the performance, dancers go from home to house, dance the star lamp, drive away evil epidemics, pray for good luck, and bring joy to people. \n\n\n\n\nThe inheritance method of Xingzi Lantern in Liling City was mainly based on family inheritance in the past, and now it is also taught in local schools. The Xingzi Lantern comes from the production and life of the working people. It is a true manifestation of the character, spirit and belief of Liling people, and has distinct local characteristics. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Liling City Cultural Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nZhang Hui displays the props needed for Xingzi Lantern\n\n\n\n\nZhang Hui\n\n(August 1967—) Male, Han nationality, from Tianxin Village, Baitutan Town, Liling City, Hunan Province, and a representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of Xingzideng, Liling City. \n\nSince 2007, he has studied with his masters Li Jiaren and Fu Peiqing, and has learned in-depth knowledge and learning the origin of Xingzi Lanterns, the production of sets, and the skills and routines of dance performances in all aspects. He formed the \"Tian Xin Xingzi Lights and Waves Dragon Dance Team\", with 28 members, mostly young people aged 17 or 18. In addition to performing Xingzi Lanterns at the local traditional festival, he also recorded programs with the \"Traveling All Over China\", \"Home in the Distance\", and \"Seven Days of Music\" by media such as CCTV, Hunan TV, and Hong Kong Phoenix TV. He participated in various cultural and artistic performances in the province many times and won honors. In 2017, a Xingzi Lantern Performance Team with an average age of about 8 years old was also formed. In 2018, a Xingzi Lantern Performance Art Training Class was launched with Liling Ceramic Fireworks Vocational and Technical School. The sixth generation inheritors of Xingzi Lanterns, including Zhang Zhiqiang and Fu Chengping, have been trained, and have contributed to the inheritance and development of Xingzi Lanterns."

In the Tang Dynasty, the Tongguan Kiln near Changsha had underglaze green and brown flower and bird patterns. Liling’s underglaze colorful porcelain takes nearly a hundred processes from raw materials to finished products, all of which are done by hand. The porcelain fillers, glazes and pigments are all made of high-quality local raw materials. Its color paintings use homemade underglaze coloring materials, and use techniques such as double-tick water-dividing and filling to dissolve the picture underglaze, making it smooth and bright, and has a full sense of moisture. The glaze covered on the pattern is fired at high temperature and forms a glassy texture, making it look even more shiny and smooth. The pigments used in underglaze multicolor porcelain are made of metal oxides as colorants. The flux does not contain toxic substances such as lead and cadmium, and can withstand acid and alkali. After forming, the blank must be simmered at 800°C to increase the strength of the blank. After the blank is painted, the picture is covered with a spray of glaze, and then the finished product is fired at a high temperature of 1350℃-1410℃, so that the colorful picture appears from the glaze layer. Its technology of using underglaze cobalt oxide coloring was widely used in later blue and white porcelain.\n\n\n\n\n　　\n\nSince modern times, Liling's underglaze colorful porcelain has won awards internationally and domestically for its unique craftsmanship and excellent quality.

During the Second Civil Revolutionary War, Mao Zedong and Zhu De established the Jinggangshan Revolutionary Base in the Hunan-Jiangxi Border Region and established the Soviet regime, which is the abbreviation of the Central Soviet Area. Songs from the Soviet area have been passed down from generation to generation in the Hunan-Jiangxi border area. A song that has been sung for a long time and has been re-created by filling in lyrics, music, etc. It expresses the thoughts and feelings of the Soviet military and civilians praising the Red Army, supporting the Soviet government, telling the pain of being bullied by local tyrants and evil gentry, inciting poor people to riot, implementing a land revolution, and actively sending their children and husbands to join the Red Army. There are many songs in the Soviet area, rich content and wide range of subjects. Songs often use metaphor techniques, and appropriately use exaggeration and metaphors. The language is popular and vivid, the emotions are strong and simple, and the atmosphere is rich in the times. In addition to its rich revolutionary ideological content, it also has the artistic characteristics of accuracy, vividness, popularness and profoundness, which is loved by the people of the Soviet area. And it has become a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and eliminate the enemy. In addition, it is generally short and the melody is easy to remember, which is best to express revolutionary pride and widely sing. When singing, it seems to be chanting and singing, and the general chapters and sentences are relatively flexible, which not only retains the expression methods of traditional songs, but also has certain creation and development. Among the songs in the Soviet area, the earliest military discipline songs and plaque-split songs were born. Representative works include \"Three Disciplines and Six Points of Attention\", \"Freedom Song\", \"Supporting the Soviet Union\", \"Victory belongs to the Workers, Peasants and Soldiers\", \"Ten Hateful Hearts\", \"Sending the Patrol to Send the Patrol\", \"Five Advocates Sisters\", \"Don't Marry the Red Army\", \"Deceased to Join the Soldiers in December\", \"The Song of Pain in Workers, Peasants and Soldiers\", etc. Songs in the Soviet area were born in arduous years and originated from the people and Red Army officers and soldiers in rural revolutionary base areas. They both originated from the masses and were recited and sung among the masses, reflecting a strong sense of time and people. Whether in propaganda and revolutionary struggle or calling for the expansion of the Red Army and carrying out regime, economic and cultural construction, it played a strong inspiration and huge combat role, and closely cooperated with the political and military struggles in the Soviet area. These red songs have simple language and sincere and moving emotions. They are still familiar classics that people can still remember. They have infected thousands of listeners. They are precious spiritual wealth left by the revolutionary war years, and are also important resources and vivid teaching materials for carrying out revolutionary traditions and patriotic education today.

    "description-en": "Traditional production process of betel nuts at the Intangible Cultural Heritage Joint Exhibition\n\n\n\n\nZhang Xinfa betel nut making technique is a traditional edible betel nut making technique, mainly circulated in Xiangtan City, Hunan Province. \n\n\n\n\nBetel nut is a plant fruit, and many tropical countries and regions have the habit of chewing betel nut. It was clearly recorded in Su Shi's \"Ode to Betel nut\" by the Song Dynasty, and it was used as a medicinal herb in the lives of the people at that time. Xiangtan has become a commercial center for the canal transportation since the Ming Dynasty. It is famous for its distribution center for Chinese medicinal materials and is known as the \"medicine capital\". Among them, betel nut has increased dramatically as the consumer population spreads, and it has gradually developed into an independent consumer product. According to the \"Xiangtan County Chronicle\" of Guangxu, during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty, General Jiu began to become a concentration of betel nut vendors. In 1905, the medicinal material merchant Zhang Xuelin founded a betel nut production process and created the \"Zhang Xinfa\" betel nut family workshop, which was listed in the outer city block of Jiuzhong, Xiangtan. Zhang Xinfa betel nut production skills include seed selection, cleaning, drying, hair making, seed cutting, core removal, brine, core removal, packing and other processes. The material selection is exquisite. Only betel nut fruits produced from betel nut trees in Yacheng Town, Wanning District, Hainan Province have been selected for more than 15 years. According to the medicinal properties of betel nut, which is \"bitter, spicy, warm, astringent, and non-toxic\", several natural auxiliary materials are used to mix them at different times to make betel nuts to stimulate the medicinal ingredients of betel nuts, ensure that betel nuts are fully tasted and can achieve the refreshing taste of betel nuts. Then, the material is made of clay tanks or even purple clay tanks with better breathability. \n\n\n\n\nThe inheritance method of Zhang Xinfa’s betel nut making skills is family inheritance. Through the inheritance and improvement of four generations, there are a series of strict process requirements in the storage of raw seeds, the standards for selecting seeds, the method of cutting seeds, the water content ratio, the brine mixing, the production process, the fragrance, the selection standards, and the packaging. Now, the company has basically achieved mechanized production in accordance with the standardized management of modern industry, but it still retains pure handmade production in process links such as material selection and slicing to ensure the quality of betel nut products. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Hunan Huangye Food Co., Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nZhang Gangqiang teaches his disciples carefully\n\n\n\n\nZhang Gangqiang\n\n(December 1962—) Male, Han nationality, from Yuhu District, Xiangtan City, Hunan Province, and a representative inheritor of Zhang Xinfa’s betel nut making skills. \n\nIn 2012, he officially took over the betel nut of \"Zhang Xinfa\" and opened a Xiangtan store. He was recognized as a \"Home Brand in Hunan\" by the Hunan Provincial Department of Commerce. Hunan Huangye Food Co., Ltd. was established to increase infrastructure construction, build two production bases in Xiangtan and Yiyang respectively, and set up betel nut technology research institutes, and hired several betel nut scientific researchers with R&D capabilities to serve as work consultants for many years to develop and ensure product quality. Establish a special management and operation team for the \"Zhang Xinfa\" brand to make strong guarantees in hardware and software construction, and continuously increase the quality control of \"Zhang Xinfa\" betel nut products to ensure product quality."

According to legend, Emperor Shun was very happy to be on the tour of Shao in the south, \"The Xiao Shao is nine times, and the phoenix is ​​brought to the ritual\", so it is named Shaoshan. In the long process of history, the gentle and soft \"Shao Music\" gradually merged with the local folk customs, resulting in Shaoshan mountain songs with rich and changeable tunes, beautiful melody, simple and natural style, and humorous and funny Shaoshan mountain songs. In the past, the transportation in Shaoshan Chong was inconvenient, and mountain songs were once part of Shaoshan people's lives. They hummed mountain songs to work, looked for their wives in the mountain songs, shouted mountain songs and missed their relatives, and sang mountain songs to celebrate the harvest. Shaoshan mountain songs can be divided into Gaokong mountain songs and Pingkong mountain songs according to the range of phonology, and can be divided into labor songs, love songs, life songs, custom songs and religious songs according to the expression form, and can be divided into solo songs, duet songs and chorus songs by one person, and can be divided into traditional mountain songs and newly created mountain songs according to time. When singing the folk songs, the Shaoshan dialect is mainly improvised, and the structure is mainly composed of five and seven sentences. The mode is mainly feather tune. The high-pitched mountain songs have more restrained and subtlety in the water town and euphemism in the minor tune, while the plain-pitched mountain songs have more humorous and humorous in the poignant beauty. In addition to the labor horns, wood-cutting songs, and field-cutting songs, etc. sung in outdoor mountains and fields, the folk songs, custom songs, religious songs, night songs, etc. sung in the room contain factors of mountain songs from the melody of singing, which can be said to be a derivative of the mountain song tune. \n\n\n\n\nShaoshan mountain songs are rooted in the folk, and people have been orally passed down through family inheritance and collective inheritance to this day.

According to relevant historical records, the production of stone drum oil paper (cloth) umbrellas began in the Song and Yuan dynasties, and has been around for more than 600 years. During the large-scale population migration during the \"Jiangxi Filling Huguang\" period, a large number of Jiangxi people moved to Hunan. One of them settled in the Shigu area with their umbrella making skills, and has been passing on the umbrella making and craftsmanship to this day. In the middle of the Qing Dynasty, Zhou Leshan, the Great Emperor of Zhou, inherited the bamboo craftsmanship skills of his ancestors, visited famous umbrella makers in various places, and updated the relevant craftsmanship, making stone drum paper umbrellas the mainstay of Hunan's umbrella making industry. The stone drum oil paper (cloth) umbrella is mainly handmade, with excellent materials, exquisite skills and exquisite products. The local specialty nan bamboo and water bamboo are selected, combined with Anhui Xuancheng special rice paper and Xiangxi tung oil, supplemented with fish bladder, forming the characteristics of bamboo bone copper top, fish glue raw lacquer, tung oil rice paper, and rattan umbrella hoop. There are more than 80 processes for making umbrella stands from soaking green bamboo, cooking potions, scraping green, splitting bones, making umbrella rods, making umbrella wheels, and then to dividing edges, wearing art, pasting umbrellas, punching mouths, drawing flowers, collecting umbrellas, quality inspection, etc., and the total production time takes 5 days. Umbrella wheels are a key link in the quality of paper umbrellas. They are divided into 20 grooves to 40 grooves according to the size of the umbrella. Then, the umbrella bones are manually installed to complete the assembly of the overall skeleton of the paper umbrella. Flower painting is the link with the highest cultural content in the entire paper umbrella process. By hand using water-based pigments to paint patterns such as plum blossoms, peonies, peach blossoms, bamboo, Xiangtan folk paper cutting and painting on the umbrella surface, it reflects the rich regional characteristics. In the past, the production process of stone drum oil paper (cloth) umbrellas was mainly inherited through family traditions, and now it is inherited through master-apprenticeship and enterprise production. In the past, the production method was simply hand workshop production, and now the assembly line operation has been partially realized. With the needs of the market, the stone drum umbrella industry has been divided into three series: tourism, craftsmanship and decoration. The umbrella surface has been expanded from traditional oil paper to flower paper, silk cloth, silk, blue and white cloth, silk, etc. The theme of umbrella painting has also been expanded from Chinese painting plum, orchid, bamboo, chrysanthemum, magpies, cranes, etc. to paper-cut and fine brushwork paintings. There are now 500 types of umbrellas, with nearly 40 flower surfaces. The function has expanded from a single rainproof to sunshade, appreciation, decoration, gift, collection, etc. Project protection unit: Xiangtan County Shigu Oil Paper (Cloth) Umbrella Production Craft Factory"

It is widely circulated in Hunan and has many practitioners. It is mainly circulated in Changsha, Xiangtan, Zhuzhou, Yueyang and other places in Hunan. Wu Family Fist was created by Wu Bida, a native of Tingzhou, Fujian. His finger-hand skills are the ancestor of Wu Fagao, the successor of Shaolin, Shanghang Leitan, Fujian. In the late Qianlong period, Wu Bida came to Hunan, and first passed down the Li and Feng families in Xiangtan, and used them as the main lineage of inheritance. Wu Family boxing cannot be small, and cannot be small, and cannot be strong. The boxing posture is compact, the strength is not exposed, and it implies the Bagua and Five Elements. It has smooth connections, interlocking, and connected styles, and completed in one go. The exercises are divided into one and three exercises, namely Kung Fu, Toad, Wandering, and Fengbeng. The boxing stance is divided into three piles, one leg, and six elbows. The three piles are valley pushing stubs, shit stubs, and snake lion stubs. One leg is bright pointed legs, and the six elbows are flat elbows, cover elbows, and inverted elbows. The left and right are the same, left and left, right and right. Wujiaquan organically combines \"external boxing\" with \"internal boxing\", which includes both various offensive and defensive techniques of Shaolin boxing and Wudang internal boxing. The routine is reasonable, the movement is compact, like flowing water, continuous. His boxing is strong, agile, clean and neat, and his momentum is unique. It integrates training, nurturing and fighting, and can be used for both martial arts and health care, suitable for men, women, young and old. For more than two hundred years, in the process of Wujiaquan spreading in various parts of Hunan, in addition to the fact that the basic essence and essence have not changed, various places have also developed and evolved differently. The ancestral book \"The Secret of the Bulletin\" written by the Zhou family in Changsha records the 188-style Wu Family Fist, which is a relatively complete Wu Family Fist Story. Wujiaquan uses boxing books as a carrier and is passed on through oral teaching. The main inheritance methods are family inheritance and master-apprentice inheritance. Wujiaquan retains rituals such as starting a factory, inviting teachers, inviting saints, offering sticks, and edicting sticks. It is currently a rare type of boxing that still retains the complete traditional martial arts rituals. It embodies the spirit of traditional Chinese martial arts such as respecting teachers and respecting the Tao, eliminating violence and maintaining good fortune.

It is widely circulated in many countries in Asia, Africa and Europe, and was introduced to China at the latest in the Jin and Yuan dynasties. Among Chinese folks, it also has names such as bronze flute, tin flute, pear blossom, and sea flute. In addition, the small suona used in Fujian Nanqu performance is called \"Aizai\" or \"Nani\"; the suona used in the accompaniment of Putian opera is called \"Plum Blossom\" or \"Blowing Whip\", and the larger one is called \"Dachang\" or \"Dahai Flute\"; the full wooden suona of the Uyghur people is called \"Surnai\"; Tibetan, Miao, Mongolian, Korean and other ethnic groups also have different tangents.\n　　\n\nThe suona consists of parts such as whistle, core, air disc, rod, copper bowl, etc., which are arranged in sequence according to the sound holes according to the seventh sound scale. The distances of each hole are basically equal and can be turned seven tones. The range of sound is generally two octaves and two degrees larger. Suona has many blowing techniques such as slip sound, snoring sound, snoring sound, snoring sound, snoring sound, circulating ventilation (long-term breathing) and other play techniques. It is a solo instrument with strong expressiveness.\n　　\n\nThe suona has a loud volume and a high tone and bright tone. It is one of the indispensable instruments in the blowing and playing band. In ancient times, in addition to playing military music, it was also used as accompaniment for yamen, opera, song and dance. In daily folk life, it was mostly used for festivals, weddings and funerals and drama scenes.\n　　\n\n\n\n\nQingshan suona is one of the types of Chinese folk music. It is mainly circulated in the Qingshan Bridge, Shigu, Fenshui and surrounding areas in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province. It is mainly played in folk weddings and funerals, dragon and lion playing, Buddhist and Taoist rituals, and witch and Nuo sacrifices. As late as the Qing Dynasty, the music of playing with suona as the main instrument was quite common in Xiangtan folk life.\n　　\n\nAccording to its historical origin, structure and performance function, the music cards of Qingshan Suona can be divided into three types: night drum sign, road drum sign and hall sign. Night drum signs are instrumental musical plaques specially used for funerals; road drum signs are mainly composed of suona and gongs and drums, and are mostly played in marching; hall signs are commonly known as \"sitting hall signs\", \"sitting hall\", \"dale music\", etc., and are a form of play and music commonly used in folk operas. In terms of music structure, name of music cards, melody characteristics, expression style, performance skills, etc., various brands still maintain a relatively primitive style. The representative music cards include \"Crying and Ignoring\", \"Dialogue Flying\", \"Little Drum\", \"Fifth Update\", \"Double Lotus Picking\", \"Nine Calls\", \"Victory Order\", \"Playing the Child\", etc.\n　　\n\nQingshan suona is processed and created based on the typical tone characteristics of central Hunan. It has strong local characteristics, reflecting the aesthetic tastes, customs and traditional concepts of the spread region, and has high artistic and folk culture research value. In the 1920s and 1930s, a large number of outstanding suona artists emerged in the Qingshanqiao area, and the Qingshanqiao Drum Music Union was established. The members of the union have superb performance skills and are well-known. The four counties of Hengxiang (Hengshan, Shuangfeng, Xiangtan, and Xiangxiang) therefore call the Qingshan suona playing \"Qingshanqiao National Music\". At present, although Qingshan Suona has a broad mass base in Qingshan Bridge and other places, it has always lacked professional and systematic research and sorting. After a large number of outstanding old artists passed away one after another, many musical cards were lost, and the phenomenon of death and art was becoming increasingly serious. The performance of Qingshan suona is also facing the crisis of extinction, and relevant parties urgently need to actively protect it.\n\n\n\n\nRelated inheritors\n\nMo Baihuai   1964.06  Han nationality  Traditional music Ⅱ-37  Suona Art (Qingshan Suona)  Xiangtan County, Hunan Province  "

    "description-en": "The \"connecting rod\" of the shadow puppet production skills\n\n\n\n\nThe production skills of paper movie dolls are a kind of drama dressing and play tools developed based on local paper movies, and are circulated in Xiangtan County, Hunan Province. \n\n\n\n\nmy country's shadow puppetry production originated from paper cutting. Since the Song Dynasty, the \"plain paper carving\" technique has been adopted. To this day, the materials used have gradually evolved from plain paper (commonly known as hemp paper) to sheepskin, cowhide, donkey skin, etc. Currently, only Hunan, Guangdong and other places still perform films with paper puppets. The history of Xiangtan paper film puppet production skills can be traced back to the Yuan Dynasty and has a history of more than 600 years. It has a typical southern shadow puppet style and is carved from plain paper. It can be completed through more than 10 processes such as pulping, shell making, cutting, drawing, single carving, synthesis, double carving, coloring, lamination, varnishing, knotting, connecting rods, etc. On average, one shadow puppet needs more than 3,000 knives to carve. Wu Shengping, in Xiangtang Township, Xiangtan City, used the \"special knife technique\" summarized by the family over several generations to make the shadow puppet production process. He used the hollowing technique of paper cutting to make the shadow puppets clustered and filed, making the shadow puppet lines smoother, the patterns more delicate, and the characters' facial features can move freely, making the film performance more vivid and vivid. The facial makeup part adopts a \"seven-point face\" style painted on film, which is much different from the \"five-point face\" in the north. Its advantage is that it has a more sense of communication with the audience during performance. The height of the shadow doll is generally 50-52 cm for women, and the common ones are 55-60 cm for men due to differences in helmets, with a head-to-body ratio close to five head-to-body ratios. The shadow puppet production uses two engraving processes. First, carve the parts that need to be filled on the two layers of paper shells, and then sandwich a layer of translucent material of paper or white silk between the two layers of paper shells, stick it firmly with glue, and then perform the second engraving. Continue to hollow out opaque parts on the paper shell to increase its light transmission and texture. The two engravings give it a clear concave and convex feeling, and the effect presented on the screen is also more layered. Paper shadow generally has only two joysticks, and some characters can add a temporary joystick when they need to show detailed actions. The general's feet have two joints, which can use inertia to show kicking and other movements.\n\n\n\n\nThe skills of making paper movie dolls are taught by oral communication, mainly based on family heritage and master-apprentice inheritance. It is closely related to local film culture and coexist and develops. Xiangtan’s “Zhongyuan Festival” rewards gods and worships ancestors. It has always had the custom of inviting to sing movies, which plays a role in educating the people and meeting the spiritual and cultural needs of the people. Xiangtan Paper Movie Doll retains the most original and complete paper-paste paper shadows in China, recreating the style of Song Dynasty film performances, and also has important reference value for studying shadow puppet styles and characteristics in different regions. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Xiangtan Shengpingxuan Culture Communication Co., Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWu Yuan\n\n(December 1984 —) Male, Han nationality, from Yuhu District, Xiangtan City, Hunan Province, a provincial representative inheritor of the intangible cultural heritage of drama dressmaking skills (paper movie doll production skills). \n\nSince high school, he has learned the skills of paper shadow making with his grandfather Wu Shengping. In 2010, he began to systematically learn family-born skills with his grandfather. He is now engaged in the inheritance and promotion of paper shadow production skills and paper shadow performance. He collected and sorted out scripts and photos, and collaborated with his grandfather to publish \"Xiangtan Local Shadow Play\" and built the Shengpingxuan Paper Shadow Museum for free.

Bai Yuchan, one of the \"Five Patriarchs of the Southern School\", had traveled several times, and Qidong Fishing Drum may have started here. Qidong Fishing Drum is a performing art that uses a \"fishing drum\" made of two feet and four inches long and nine inches long and a circumference of nine inches, covered with pig skin film as the main performance instrument, and is a performing art that combines rap. It raps in Qidong dialect, and integrates folk arts such as local minor tunes, flower drums and Qi operas in its development. It has gone through the stages of walking, sitting, group singing, and color singing. The performance has also developed from one person stand-up and two people to the form of multi-people. The lyrics include the opening, the main lyrics and the ending. The opening is also called \"introduction\", which is the lyrics that start with the fishing drum joke. It is generally four sentences, and mostly quotes ancient poems; the regular lyrics are the main body of the lyrics, and generally four sentences are a musical paragraph, with a vivid and lively plot, fluctuating and fascinating; the ending is also called \"shock end\", which is seen in four sentences, often echoing the opening. The structure of the lyrics is mostly seven-character sentences and cross sentences, and also uses five-character sentences and sentence styles of different lengths. Qidong Yugu Music is a plate-cavity structure mainly based on single cards, belonging to the four-sentence style of origin, inheritance, rotation and integration. Singing styles are generally divided into the opening style, the main theme, and the tail style: the opening style is the opening style, which is high-pitched, exciting, and expressive; the main theme is the correct lyrics, the tune is the simple and thick tune, the pronunciation is clear and narrative; the tail style is the ending style, which is basically the same as the main theme, except that when the final sentence is dragged, the octave should be slowed down and the octave should be increased as appropriate. The accompaniment instruments were the moon qin and the erhu, and later they were also mixed with plucking music, blowing music and electric vocal music. Artists are often both actors and musicians, with multiple roles. Inherited through the inheritance of master and apprenticeship. \n\n\n\n\nQidong Fishing Drum carries simple humanistic emotions and is closely linked to the lives of the people in southern Hunan. It is a vivid record of the living and vivid social situation in southern Hunan, and an indispensable and important part of the customs of life in southern Hunan. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Qidong County Intangible Cultural Heritage Protection Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nPhotos of Zou Huachun's teaching apprenticeship\n\n\n\n\nZou Huachun\n\n(February 1967—) Male, Han nationality, from Qiutang Village, Shitingzi Town, Qidong County, Hunan Province, a member of the Chinese Folk Art Association, and a representative inheritor of Qidong Yugu's provincial intangible cultural heritage. \n\nIn 1992, he learned to sing fishing drums by Chen Chunyuan, a famous fishing drum artist in Qidong. The system mastered the singing skills of traditional fishing drums and formed their own style. The lyrics are easy to understand, the mouth is humorous, the characters are delicately portrayed, the forms are vivid, and the stage is flexible and changeable. He compiled dozens of Qidong traditional fishing drum scripts, including \"The Legend of Wooden Hairpin\", \"The Strange Injustice of the Deep Palace\", and created and arranged many large-scale modern fishing drum dramas and fishing drum programs such as \"My Parents\", \"Tears of the Mother\", \"Advising Marriage\", and \"Thousand Family Grain\". We have vigorously cultivated reserve talents for fishing and drums, and successively won 14 apprentices including Jiang Qin, Xie Qingzhao, Xiao Zhijie.

It respects Buddhism and folk auspicious gods (Ao Wang and Ao Mu) live in harmony in the same temple. It is mainly popular in Dashi Township, Leiyang City, Hunan Province, with Aoshan Temple and the surrounding six villages as the main activity venues. Aoshan Temple is an ancient temple located in Dashi Township, Leiyang. It was originally built in the Southern Dynasty. Around 947 AD, there was a famine in Aoshan, and the people were living in poverty. Liu Zhiyuan, the Emperor of the Later Han Dynasty, was close to the rule and loved the people. The people survived the great disaster and respected Liu Zhiyuan as the holy emperor. During the Yongzheng period of the Qing Dynasty, in order to commemorate Liu Zhiyuan's power and show his sage, the people changed the \"Zhen'an Temple\" built in the Southern Dynasty to the Temple of the Emperor Ao King's Emperor, and later called the Aoshan Temple. The temple is full of incense and has a great reputation. There are many incense activities every year at the Aoshan Temple Fair. The cruise on the second day of the first lunar month is one of the annual large-scale activities. The people from the six local administrative villages (divided into three halls and twenty-three bows) carried out three paper boats (one in three upper, middle and lower halls each) to Aoshan Temple to worship the gods. At around 8 o'clock that morning, the three boat seats were divided into three teams and patrolled each natural village according to the routes prescribed by his ancestors. On the 19th of February, Guanyin’s birthday, a four-day prayer event was held at Aoshan Temple. On the eighth day of the fourth month, Shi Jia Buddha's birthday is on the eighth day of the fourth month, and the Buddha is worshipped. The legend of May 23 is King Ao's birthday. He started singing operas until all night on the afternoon of the 22nd, celebrated birthdays on the morning of the 23rd, and sang morning books every morning from the 24th to the 26th until the afternoon of the 27th. The main types of dramas are Han opera and Huagu opera, and the actors' costumes are relatively standardized, generally according to the traditional dress style of the drama, such as square official hats, beard hangings, large-sleeved long gowns in Han opera. There are no specific regulations for the pilgrimage costumes in Aoshan Temple Fair. In addition, there are temple fairs such as \"Three Halls\" held a meeting ceremony for the bow of the current and next bow of the bow of the first lunar month, and \"Incense Meeting\" on August 15th. It can be said that there are many believers and the incense is endless. The Aoshan Temple Fair worships Buddha and worships gods. It also respects the Dharma and forms its own etiquette. During the event, pilgrims and believers from all over the country gather in Aoshan to pray to God and burn incense to fulfill their vows. It has a wide influence and is of high value for studying the local folk culture of Leiyang. Project protection unit: Leiyang Cultural Center"

    "description-en": "The traditional production techniques of Qidong straw mats produced by Qidong Jinqiao are mainly circulated in Qidong County, Hunan Province, and are also spread in Hengyang County, Qiyang County and other places. Qidong has a mild climate all year round, which is very suitable for the growth of mattresses. It is a famous \"straw mat town\". Qidong straw mats have a long history. According to folk legend, the seats in the south originated in the ancient town of Guiyang, Qidong during the Western Han Dynasty. In 1929, the products of Guiyang Jingye Weaving Factory entered the domestic and foreign markets. In 1936, the annual output of straw mats reached 300,000, and were sold well in all parts of the country, as well as in Japan, Australia, New Zealand and other countries. There is still a folk proverb in the local area that \"the mat is not loud, the pot is cold\", which vividly reflects the important position of the mat weaving industry in people's economic life. The traditional Qidong straw mat production tools mainly include \"well-shaped\" mat stands, accompanied by wooden hammers, scissors, cutters, hemp ropes or cotton yarns for later use. Its production is purely manual operation, with exquisite material selection and complicated process. Weaving requires two people to cooperate. On the basis of completing the preparations for planting, harvesting, color preservation, drying, storage of mat grass, and making auxiliary materials such as wood ash, hemp rope, dyes, and printing plates, it also needs to go through more than ten steps such as mixing hemp, removing shells and soaking weeding, cloth warp, anvil, weaving, weaving, removing edges, cutting edges, drying, mat wipes, and printing. Among them, cloth meridians are a relatively critical step in the traditional production technology of Qidong straw mats. It is necessary to use hemp rope to hang the regular frame and the vertical stick on the balance of the mat rack, and be placed in parallel and horizontal lines, then lay the left and right side meridians and the middle meridians, and then spread them in turn and adjust the meridians. Qidong straw mats are finely made, the mat surface is flat and smooth, the pattern is beautiful and elegant, the color is bright, soft and wear-resistant, and are essential products for ordinary people's daily life. Sleeping on straw mat in summer, your sweat is not sticky, and it is comfortable and smooth. Especially the natural fragrance of mattress can make people feel the freshness of the mountains. The traditional production skills of Qidong straw mats mainly rely on family or master-apprentice inheritance. The process is fine and complicated, and is the crystallization of the wisdom of the working people. The straw mat is printed with patterns such as words, animals, flowers and plants, and has rich meanings. It not only expresses people's good wishes such as harvest, good luck, and longing together, but also a carrier of local ethnic and folk culture inheritance.

Jiepai Town is located in the western part of Hengshan, Nanyue. It has rich porcelain clay reserves, and the mineral source extends for more than 30 miles, with excellent quality and a whiteness of more than 93 degrees. It is an ideal raw material for firing high-end artistic porcelain and daily porcelain.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to the \"Hengyang City Chronicles\", as early as the Daoguang period of the Qing Dynasty, the Ma brothers made porcelain in Jiepai Paiziling. In the second year of the Republic of China, the eight brothers of Wang Zhiba introduced \"foreign ink\" (cobalt oxide) for the first time and fired underglaze colored porcelain, which reached its peak after the founding of New China. Jiepai underglaze colorful porcelain products are simple and heavy, with simple and vivid carvings, and both artistic and practical functions.

First, the two parties must be relatively unfamiliar with each other, the other is compatible with the opposite sex, and the third is that they must be of the same age. The entire process of Yao people talking and laughing is divided into three parts. The first part is \"Welcome song\". A guest came to the village. The neighbor organized three or five singers to come to the boss's house to accompany the guests. The host agreed that the singers from both sides would sing with marriage and tea tribute to each other to greet the guests, asking them about their name, residence, production, and life. The second part is \"Sitting on the Song Hall\". The singers from both sides answered with \"Gang Zong\" (speaking song), from tea songs, wine songs, cigarette songs, history songs, flower picking songs, longing songs, and the songs of the update songs.

The February 8th Temple Fair in Quanhu began in the Ming Dynasty and has a history of more than 600 years. Legend has it that Quanhu Lake has been drought for years, and the crops were basically unharvestable every year, and the people's lives were even more miserable. This situation alarmed Lord Shou Fu. He immediately cast a spell to bring heavy rain, so the crops that year were able to harvest a great harvest. From then on, in order to commemorate the kindness of Lord Shou Fu Fu, people specially held a temple fair on the 8th day of the lunar calendar on the birthday of Lord Shou Fu, which lasted for three days. As the impact gradually expands, the temple fair radiates to many surrounding areas such as Hengyang County, Qidong County, Changning City, and the temples are in full bloom all year round. During the temple fair, good men and women from all walks of life came to worship, make wishes and pray, and parade around the streets, which was very lively. People in the street market are preparing for the year of agricultural production, especially for the upcoming spring farming production after the Spring Festival. Cow trading, agricultural tools trading, production and living materials trading are the main transaction contents. February 8 of Quanhu becomes the last climax of the Spring Festival activities every year. People watch operas, listen to fishing drums, and go to distant relatives, and have a happy and festive atmosphere. The temple fair culture has promoted the development of operas and folk arts such as Hengzhou Huagu Opera, Hengyang Hunan Opera, Qi Opera, Shadow Puppetry, and Fishing Drum, and is loved by the people. Quanhu on February 8th has become a local comprehensive cultural brand integrating religion, folk art, farming, commerce, and traditional folk customs.

    "description-en": "Shishi bamboo root carving work \"Arhat\"\n\n\n\n\nShishi bamboo and wood carving is an art of carving with local bamboo and wood as materials, and is circulated in Zhongling Village, Shishi Town, Hengyang County, Hunan Province. \n\n\n\n\nShishi bamboo and wood carving art has a long history. The Ming and Qing dynasties were the heyday of the development of bamboo and wood carving art. There were many artists, rich creation content, diverse forms and categories, and high artistic achievements. Bamboo carvings are divided into root carving, elixir carving and special-shaped carving. The subject matter is mainly mythological stories, Buddhist culture, dragons, phoenixes, lions, and unicorns. The production process of bamboo carving includes 8 steps: material selection, drying, design, blank production, steaming, carving, grinding, and polishing. Wood carvings generally use fine and tough texture and are not easy to deform, such as carvings made of high-quality wood such as nanmu, red sandalwood, camphor wood, cypress, ginkgo, agarwood, mahogany, longan and other high-quality woods. The production process of wood carving is divided into steps such as drawing, chiseling, polishing, and coloring. The bamboo and wood carvings in Shishi City are realistic in shape, romantic in style, vivid in spirit, delicate and free in swordsmanship, smooth lines, and natural stretches. The process flow is complex and requires meticulous craftsmanship, unity of mind and form, and form is born from the heart. The material must be in a natural state that can be used, and it is best to dry it air. The polishing must be rubbed and grinded in the direction of the material fibers. In all process flows, carving is a \"serious scene\", which requires the knife to be held straight, the knife to be moved quickly, the positioning must be accurate, the hands should be as good as they wish, and the skills should be made. The techniques include round carving, relief carving and hollow carving. The bamboo and wood carvings in Shishi Township are mainly round carvings, and the shapes are mainly arc-shaped. His main works include \"The Great Sage Emperor\", \"Five Kings\", \"Four Heavenly Kings\", \"Laozi Riding a Face\", \"Panlong\", \"Guanyin Sitting on the Lotus Platform\", \"Master Zhao\", \"Looking Back to the Lion\", etc. \n\n\n\n\nThe main ways to inherit bamboo and wood carving in Shishi are family inheritance and master-apprentice inheritance. There are still many bamboo and wood carvings in Shishi Township, and their footprints are all over the country. Not only did it undertake the construction and restoration of famous buildings and ancient temples and cultural landscapes in Hengshan, Nanyue, Guilin, Guangxi, Foshan, Guangdong, Luoyang, Henan, etc., but it also produced a large number of bamboo and wood carving products with both aesthetic value and practical functions to put them on the market. Shishi bamboo and wood carving has become a local characteristic cultural business card. In May 2000, the former Ministry of Culture awarded the title of \"Hometown of Chinese Folk Art (Bamboo and Wood Carving)\" by Shishi Township, Hengyang County. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Hengyang County Cultural Center (Hengyang County Art Museum [Academy of Calligraphy and Calligraphy] Hengyang County Intangible Cultural Heritage Protection Center)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiang Fengzhu\n\n(July 1946 -) Male, Han nationality, from Shuangxin Village, Zhajiang Town, Hengyang County, Hunan Province, senior arts and crafts artist, member of the China Folk Arts and Artists Association, member of the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society, and representative inheritor of provincial intangible cultural heritage of bamboo carvings (Shishi bamboo and wood carvings). \n\nLiang Fengshu's ancestors made a living by bamboo and wood carving. He learned bamboo and wood carving skills from his father at the age of 12 and was the fifth generation descendant of Liang's bamboo and wood carving. In 1978, he joined the Hengshan County Arts and Crafts Factory. Since 1979, he has been involved in the maintenance of Nanyue Temple and Nanyue Buddhist and Taoist Temples, and has presided over the design and production of the Nanyue Temple Saint Emperor and six statues of the Shangshu.

After the clan sacrificial activities ended, the peasant family began to taste it. Each family must cook a fresh rice and prepare a table of hearty wine and food. First, put fish, meat, wine and food on the shrine, set off firecrackers, burn incense and paper, and worship ancestors. The housewife served a bowl of fresh rice, put the fish in it, and barked the dog to the shrine, so that the dog could taste it first. The male owner then took the three-bearing half-ripe rice seedlings cut from the field in advance to the cow pen, wrapped the rice seedlings with meat and vegetables, and respectfully invited the cow to taste the new. Then, the whole family sat around the table in order of old and young. After the oldest elder tasted the first bite, everyone started to taste the new ones. Respect the ancestors and respect the elderly and be grateful. This is a rule passed down from generation to generation and a traditional virtue of the Wugang people. For those who have worked hard for half a year, Tasting the New Festival is a rare festival for relaxation. People enjoy themselves, raise their glasses and drink, and look forward to a good harvest. The inheritance method of the new festival on June 6th is mainly the collective inheritance of the clan. The Tasting Festival is a microcosm of people's lives in the farming society, and has certain reference value for studying the production, life and customs of the farming society.

It is popular in 17 counties and cities in eastern southern Hunan, as well as in western southern Jiangxi and in Guangdong, Pingshi, Qimen, Lechang, Guitou, Lishi, Shaoguan and other places. Because it once used Changsha and Xiangtan as the activity centers, it is also called Changsha Xiang Opera. Hunan opera combines a variety of voice tunes such as Kunqu Opera, Gaotu, Tantu and Miscellaneous Minor Tunes. From the early Ming Dynasty to the Jiajing period, Kunqu Opera and Yiyang Opera introduced to Hunan were combined with local dialects and folk music to form Hunan opera.\n　　\n\nThere are many repertoires of Hengyang Hunan Opera, including 6 consecutive plays, 113 whole plays and 465 spoiled plays. \"The Investiture of the Gods\", \"The Biography of Yue Fei\", \"The Biography of Mulian\", \"The Golden Seal\", \"The Notes of the White Rabbit\", \"The Moon Worship\", \"The Four Jinshis\", \"The Strange Shuanghui\", etc. are all representative plays.\n　　\n\n\n\n\nThe Hunan opera roles should be divided into 12 lines, including 12 lines including big, second, singing, small, big, white, purple, three, main, and workmanship. The young actors also have 12 styles: literary scarf, silk hat, pheasant tail, and python. There are four styles: poor, literary, rich, and martial. Hunan opera performances fully absorb the artistic factors of Kunqu opera, sing and dancing, are lively and lively, and have a group of plays that are famous for their shapes and skills. The \"blue shoe road\" that walks forward with slippers, the \"boat road\" that stands independent of the golden rooster, the \"drunk road\" that staggers, and the \"big-foot road\" that walks in the Danxing performance all have distinctive characteristics of the drama. There are more than 300 branches of Hunan opera, mainly Nanqu. In addition to the south and north roads, there are also Anti-South Road, Anti-North Road, Pingpan, Anqing Die, Qiqian, etc. When singing, the song is accompanied by suona, flute, etc., and the Hunan opera accompanies it into a civil and military scene. The literary venue uses orchestral instruments such as second string, moon qin, flute, suona and other orchestral instruments in combination with singing style, while the martial arts are performed with percussion instruments such as drum boards, large cymbals, and large gongs.\n　　\n\nAfter hundreds of years of artistic practice, Hengyang Hunan Opera has become an independent opera opera in Hunan. Tan Baocheng is the founder of the Tan School of performing arts in Hengyang Hunan Opera. His performances are deeply influenced by Kunqu opera art, strong and elegant, and unique. In October 1952, his starring \"Drunk and Killing the Mountain Gate\" participated in the first national opera observation performance and was highly praised by party and state leaders such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai, as well as famous performing artists such as Mei Lanfang.\n　　\n\nKunqu created Hengyang Hunan Opera. Hengyang Hunan Opera regarded Kunqu as its soul, and at the same time combined elegant Kunqu art with regional culture, achieving a state of appreciation between the elite and the masses. This practice of localizing and ruralizing foreign elegant art has important value in the study of opera history and even art history. At present, due to the impact of modern culture, the relationship between Hunan opera and audience is becoming increasingly weak. Coupled with the lack of funds and loss of talents, the survival of Hunan opera is facing a severe situation, which is worthy of attention from relevant parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated inheritors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXia Chuanjin Male 1969.03 Traditional Drama Ⅳ-13 Hunan Opera Hengyang City, Hunan Province\n\n\nTan Dongbo   Male  1949.06.06  Traditional Drama  Ⅳ-13  Xiang Opera  Hengyang City, Hunan Province  "

It is also known as \"Nanyue Pilgrimage\" or \"incense\", \"burn incense\" and \"return incense\". It is circulated in Nanyue District, Hengyang City, Hunan Province.\n\n\n\n\nThe Nanyue Temple Fair originated from ancestor worship, mountain god worship, yin and yang and five elements and astrology, and was formed in the Southern Song Dynasty at the latest. The Nanyue Temple Fair is based on the Spring Festival temple fair, \"Huo Palace Temple Fair Opera Performance Sugar Paintings at Fire Palace Temple Fair in August\" temple fair and the Tianfu Temple Fair as carriers. It is a folk activity spontaneously organized and inherited by the Chu people as descendants of the Fire God and Hengshan Mountain God Zhurong. It mainly uses the folk activities of repaying gods and thanking gods, exorcising evil and eliminating disasters, praying for blessings and longevity, and carnival in society. It reproduces the historical context of the multicultural integration of the Hunan-Chu area and has a wide social influence in southern China. The Spring Festival temple fair was held from the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month to the Lantern Festival the following year. It is a New Year prayer event for the people to thank their ancestor Zhu Rong for their blessings. It includes porridge for Laba, snatching incense on New Year's Eve, lantern delivery, lantern parades, fire lantern dancing, dragon and lion dance, stilt juggling, Buddhist and Taoist rituals, etc. From the eighth day of the twelfth lunar month, monks in temples beg for alms to collect rice, cook Laba porridge, and deliver Spring Festival couplets; every household rushed to the streets, climbed up the hill, and was fortunate to drink Laba porridge, see rime, and get couplets from the monks' avenue. In the early morning of the first day of the lunar month, tens of thousands of people rushed to the Nanyue Temple from all directions to greet the Bodhisattvas, and then bowed to each other to celebrate the New Year. The number of people coming in every year is more than 100,000, which is called \"traveling out of heaven\". The fifteenth day of the first lunar month is not only the day when the god of fire in the southern mountain, the Holy Emperor Zhurong spreads fire seeds to the world, but also the Christmas of the traditional Chinese Yuan Festival and Taoist Tianguan Emperor. The temple fair is grand, with the main contents of passing on lanterns, street stories, pilgrimage to dragons, and lights from thousands of families. The temple fair \"Catching August\" will be held from the seventh to the nineth lunar calendar. There are pilgrims from all ethnic groups worshipped by the Fire God in the south, stepping on gossip, chanting incense songs, holding incense and kowtowing to the Southern Mountains for pilgrimage, praying for their parents to live long and have a prosperous life. The Tianfu Temple Fair was held from the 10th to 17th day of the fifth lunar month. It aims to drive away plagues and ward off evil spirits and keep health care first. People carry the Tianfu Emperor to parade the streets, including \"carrying stories\", \"earth stories\", and \"clearing the way\", \"testing judges\". The Nanyue Temple Fair focuses on teaching and Taoism, and has formed its own inheritance system, which has promoted the inheritance of Zhurong's \"fire\" culture.\n\n\n\n\nAround the temple fair, a cultural space has been formed that integrates religious culture, festival culture, commercial culture, living customs, traditional art and Chinese martial arts in southern China. It has a complete folk belief and custom culture system, distinct regional characteristics and religious and cultural atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Nanyue District Cultural and Art Museum, Hengyang City\n\n\n\n\nA story of carrying the Tianfu Temple Fair (photo by Zhao Zhi)\n\n\n\n\nParade of fire lamps in the temple fair during the Spring Festival (Photo by Xie Yongli)"

According to Chetang's \"Li Family Genealogy\", in the fourth year of Hongwu in the Ming Dynasty, the ancestor Li Dechang (Zu Ergong) migrated from Humang, Jiangxi Province, Chetangpu, Xiyi, Baoqing. Following the experience of Jiangxi ancestors, combined with the essence of northern sorcerers, he compiled and printed the \"Wangxinglou Tongshu\". Due to the accurate calculation, it was gradually accepted by people. Since then, Wangxinglou Tongshu's calculation results have been published every year with a yellow cover booklet for distribution nationwide. \"Wangxinglou Tongshu\" integrates astronomy, geography, folk customs, and prediction, creatively adopts arc angle algorithms, integrates the longitude and latitude of heaven and earth, and focuses on the arrival of spring and autumn, summer and winter, and can accurately calculate the occurrence time of the twenty-four solar terms, solar eclipse, and lunar eclipse, and predict the harvest and people's actions in the coming year.

Tongshu began to calculate the final draft after Qingming Festival every year, and craftsmen were hired to write, make boards, engrave and print around Dragon Boat Festival, and was issued after the Mid-Autumn Festival. The custom of Wangxing Tower reading has done a lot of research and practice in observing the astronomical phenomena, determining the solar terms, divining the year wind, and measuring the auspicious days. In the era where farming is the main focus, the results of reading reading have reached considerable accuracy and level, and have influenced the Meishan region of Hunan, southern China's provinces, and some areas in Southeast Asia. Objectively speaking, the custom of Wangxinglou Tongshu is edited in response to people's production and life needs. People's production and life needs have enriched the connotation of Tongshu, and the distribution of Tongshu has promoted the development of folk customs.

It mainly originated and spread in Longshan area of ​​Xinshao County, Hunan Province. The sacrifice of the Medicine King Sun Simiao (photo by Lu Jianshe) in the Hall of Medicine King Sun Simiao (photo by Lu Jianshe) Dalong Mountain between Lianyuan City and Xinshao County, Hunan Province, is commonly known as Longshan by the locals. Because of its rich medicinal resources, it has the reputation of \"The Medicine Mountain in the World\". When Zhang Zhongjing, a medical saint in the Han Dynasty, was appointed as the prefect of Changsha, he accompanied the county magistrate of Zhaoling (now Shaoyang) to climb Longshan to collect herbs. According to the local \"Sun Family Genealogy\", Sun Simiao, the medicine king of the Tang Dynasty, once lived in Longshan to collect medicine and practice medicine, wrote \"Qianjin Yao Prescription\" and \"Qianjin Yi Prescription\", and left a descendant. There are famous scenic spots such as Shun Shuo Stone, Washing Pool, Sunjia Bridge, Sunshui River, Yilongtan, and Zhihuping on the top of Longshan, all of which are the remains of ancient sites related to Sun Simiao. In order to commemorate Sun Simiao, local people built the Palace of Medicine King. By raping the story of the Medicine King and worshiping Sun Simiao, they praised the medical ethics, medical style and medical skills of the Medicine King Sun Simiao, educated people to be good at valuing medicine and establish good morals; they incorporated the lifestyle and hygiene customs advocated by Sun Simiao, such as home selection, character cultivation, massage, guidance, medicinal diet therapy, medicinal bath, taboos, etc. into life and health practice, and carried out self-health care and prevention and treatment; according to Sun Simiao's understanding and requirements of Chinese herbal medicine, Chinese herbal medicine was formed, and the Longshan Medicine King medical culture was formed. Longshan Pharmaceutical King's medical culture includes Pharmaceutical King's medicine, health science, Taoist practice and care, food culture, medical ethics culture, hygiene customs, legends and beliefs of the people, cultural relics, etc. Since the end of the Tang Dynasty, it has integrated into the production, life and medical care practice of the people, and formed the custom of \"Nine out of ten people's medicine (medicine)\", which has nurtured more than 100 medical scientists, health care experts, and Taoist coaches to support their families, including Zhou Xueting, Li Daochun, Sun Dingyi, and He Shu. All the famous ancient doctors after Sun Simiao inherited Sun Simiao's medical and health care ideas, theories, methods and techniques, and especially his medical ethics ideas are models and behavioral principles pursued by famous doctors throughout the ages. Longshan Medicine King’s Medicine Culture is a unique medical culture that integrates Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism, witchcraft and medicine. In recent years, Xinshao County has attached great importance to the inheritance and protection of Longshan Yaowang's medical culture. Through the exploration and sorting of a number of ancient methods and prescriptions, combined with modern technological improvements, the Yaowang's medical culture has played a role in promoting the development of modern traditional Chinese medicine, which can not only better serve the people's health, but also contribute to the local economy.

They are a traditional competitive and entertainment activity that is deeply loved by the people. They are mainly circulated in Baicang Town and Wufengpu Town in Shaoyang County, Hunan Province. The main manifestation of Shirakura stilts is that the artist performs on long wooden stilts. \n\n\n\n\nIt began in the early Qing Dynasty and flourished during the Xianfeng period. In the early years of the Republic of China, the Wu, Zeng and He families in the Baicang successively established the \"Rui Lion Club\" and \"Gao Lion Club\" mainly on stilts. In 1949, the \"Rui Lion Club\" and \"Gao Lion Club\" were merged into the \"Lantern Festival\". Shirakura stilts attract audiences with their characteristics of \"high\", \"risk\" and \"strange\". The height refers to the height of the stilts in the White Cang. The maximum stilts can reach 12 feet or 2 feet. Generally, stilts are about 6 feet or 5 inches for performance, and 3 feet or 5 inches for low stilts. The artist walks on this unusual stilt, and uses strange and dangerous movements to express a harmonious plot, which far exceeds the image in real life, becoming a god giant in people's minds; strange means that the shape of the Shirakura stilt is strange, and the characters are mostly from myths and legends and folk stories, mainly in dramatic characters, with exaggerated and ancient makeup colors, and the image strives to be vivid and interesting; strange means that the performance of the Shirakura stilt is difficult. The stilt artist must have solid legs and feet and martial arts foundation in order to perform difficult stunts such as dragon and lion dance, rolling forward and backward, leaping and hovering on the stilts. There are differences between literary and military affairs in the white stilts. Wen Gaozhao mainly performs dramatic roles on stilts, with funny appearance and funny performances. His representative works include \"Zhu Bajie carrying his wife\", \"Brows chopping woodcutter\", \"Eight Immortals Crossing the Sea\", etc.; Wu Gaozhao mainly displays the stunts and skills on stilts, with thrilling movements and intense performances. His representative works include \"Journey to the West\", \"Dragon and Lion on stilts\", etc. It is mostly combined with performance activities such as the dry lotus boat, fake back, shell-boosting objects, storytelling, yangko dance and suona gongs and drums to form a stilt team. It will perform on the street during the Spring Festival, June 19th and September 9th. The costumes are based on yellow and red, and the festive scenes are expressed with big red and green. \n\n\n\n\nThe White Cang stilts are mainly passed on family and collective inheritance. It has rich content and grand scenes, with strong local characteristics in central Hunan and strong artistic appeal. Each performance is like an invisible bond, sucking the villagers and elders from all over the countryside to Baicang, presenting a festive and joyful scene. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Stilt Art Troupe, Baicang Town, Shaoyang County\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nHe Dongxiang parade performance\n\n\n\n\nHe Dongxiang\n\n(November 1967—) Male, Han nationality, from Baicang Village, Baicang Town, Shaoyang County, Hunan Province, and a representative inheritor of provincial intangible cultural heritage of Baicang stilts. \n\nHe practiced martial arts since childhood.

From ancient times to the present, Hua Yao has always implemented monogamy and a foreign marriage system with no intermarriage in the same surname. The entire marriage process of Huayao’s marriage customs can be divided into love, engagement, marriage, and returning home. On festive nights, men, women, and young people in Huayao often use \"night chat\" (singing folk songs) to spend a good night together. During the duet of the folk songs, young unmarried men and women in Huayao developed love for each other because of the songs, which is Huayao's saying that \"mountain songs are the matchmaker\". Yaoyu calls engagement \"calls a cup of money\". The young man Hua Yao invited the matchmaker to go to the woman's house to ask for a marriage. Generally, the mediaman went to the woman's house for more than three transfers before the woman agreed to choose an auspicious day to get engaged. Among the Huayao ethnic group, most of the matchmakers are male elders who are respected, have children and grandchildren, and are good at singing folk songs, and are called \"Matchmakers\". Welcoming and seeing off the marriage. On the night of the wedding, the groom and bride did not enter the bridal chamber. All guests and relatives and friends accompanied them to carry out entertainment activities such as \"night chat\" (singing folk songs), \"beating the thunder\" (shuttering the butt), and \"frying the thunder and plum shells\". On the third day of the wedding, the couple went back to their parents' home to \"return\". There are thousands of folk songs throughout Huayao’s wedding customs, divided into two major tunes, eight major tunes, twelve half rhymes. The ancient song \"Night Sang\" is divided into \"Matchmakers\", \"Persuading\", \"Instructions\", and \"Historical Chapter\". The lyrics include Huayao's rich historical, cultural, moral concepts, social rules, etc., and are extremely valuable materials for studying Huayao's culture. Huayao’s marriage has been passed down from generation to generation, and there is no distinction between portals, masters and apprentices, or genealogy. The formation of Huayao’s marriage customs is closely related to the historical development of Huayao, and is an important carrier for concentrated reflection and inheritance of Huayao’s national culture.

It is circulated in the Yao ethnic settlements such as Huxingshan Yao Township, Xiaoshajiang Town, Dashuitian Township, and Matangshan Township of Longhui County, Hunan Province. Their activity locations are located in Shuidongping Village, Maoao Village and Chongmutang Village. \"Recruiting conversion\" and \"Reconsideration\" are the most grand and solemn traditional festivals of Huayao people in Longhui County every year. \"加加加加\" and \"加加加加\" are both transliterations of Yao. \"加\" means \"加加\" in Chinese, \"加\" means \"加加\" in Chinese, \"加加\" means sacrifice, \"加加加\" means sacrifice through blood and tears; \"加加加加加加\" means \"加加加加\" means the curse of the Bodhisattva. \"Recruiting conversion\" and \"Reconsideration\" were originally three-day activities to comfort the martyrs and commemorate heroes for the day when each surname of Huayao chose his own family. In the first half of the year, it is called \"consider worship\" and in the second half of the year, it is called \"consider conversion\". The \"consideration\" on May 15, 16 and 17 of the lunar calendar is from Feng's family, and the scene is in Shuidongping; the \"consideration\" on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th of the lunar calendar is from Liu's family, and the scene is in Datuo, and later moved to Maoao; the \"consideration\" on the 8th, 9th and 10th of the lunar calendar is from Shen's family, and the scene is in Xiaoshajiang, and has moved to Chongmutang in recent years. There is also the scene where Bu's \"consideration\" was in Zhaijia Chong at the foot of Xianglu Mountain, which has been forgotten by future generations. In the early days, Huayao's \"recruitment of conversion\" mainly used the method of worshiping ancestors and cultural entertainment as a cover, and studied festival activities for the development of the nation itself, resisting the suppression of the court, and developing the national economy. During the \"return to the officials\", all clans of Huayao gathered all the men of the tribe together to hold a \"Clan Conference\" to worship their ancestors together, and publicly tell the history of their migration and the process of their development and growth. Each household must also report the increase and decrease of their family population in one year at the meeting, and publicly recommend talented and prestigious people as patriarchs. Through this move, we will collect and understand the population and economic development of Huayao, and discuss plans to fight against enemies and take action. After the founding of New China, with the full implementation of ethnic policies, Huayao compatriots were grateful for the leadership of the Communist Party and gave new connotations to the activities. Now, every \"Review\" and \"Review of the Conversion\" Festival, Yao and Han compatriots have to perform large-scale folk customs. It brings together Huayao clothing, Huayao flower picking, Huayao mountain songs, Bayin gongs and drums, Kaitai gongs and drums, flower picking dance, bangzi dance, Dongdong dance and other folk art essences, focusing on displaying Huayao's sings, drinking wine to the door, sitting on the table, playing stew, and wiping mud. Huayao's \"return to the Conversion\" was collectively inherited by the Huayao people and passed down from generation to generation. It not only carries many important historical and cultural information of the Huayao people, but also has developed into a grand event for Yaohan to jointly discuss national unity, display national culture, develop border trade, and develop national economy.

The main raw materials for oil pressing in Shaoyang County include camellia seeds, rapeseed, peanuts, sesame, and tung oil seeds. The manual oil pressing process includes three major processes: stone milling, grinding, sieve, steaming materials and cake packing, and wood oil extraction. There are more than ten steps such as fruit picking, fermenting, drying fruit, removing shelling, drying seeds, grinding, sieving, baking, steaming, wrapping cake, pressing oil, and filtration. First remove the dry oil seeds from the shell and remove miscellaneous materials. Fry them in a special wok over a slow heat, then place them in a stone mill and crush them into powder. Sieve them through a fine sieve, and then put them back into the mill tray to grind. Put the fried and grinded oil powder into steamer, and cover them with a bucket of oil powder on the steamer. Use a bucket of oil powder to pour it into the cloth in the steamer. Use your hands to spread it evenly, cover it with a steamer, steam it over a high heat until the steamer rises enough saturation, and quickly pour it into a straw bag spread in the iron hoop and tie it with straw or wheat poles, and quickly wrap it into a cake shape with your feet.

In order to resist the smog and marrow and prevent and treat diseases, they added appropriate amounts of miscellaneous grains and condiments to the tea soup to form the prototype of \"oil tea\". The variety of tea determines the quality of tea soup. The main tea varieties of Chengbu Oil Tea are Dongcha and Yuancha, which are usually picked two or three days before and after the Grain Rain. The raw materials for its production also include glutinous rice flour, tapioca flour, rice, corn, peanuts, soybeans, glutinous rice cakes, as well as seasonings such as peppers, garlic, ginger, chopped green onion, coriander, pepper and other condiments. Making oil tea generally includes the steps of selecting tea leaves, processing tea leaves, making yin rice, processing corn, making small glutinous rice cakes, peeling peanuts, selecting soybeans, stir-frying yin rice, stir-frying corn, stir-frying peanuts and soybeans, stir-frying glutinous rice cakes, cooking tea soup, raising seasonings, brewing and other steps. It is a high-standard etiquette for the Miao people to entertain guests with oil tea. Oil tea banquets are often held in various wedding and white events and major festivals. In daily life, in addition to drinking oil tea three times a day, the Miao people always have sufficient oil tea raw materials. If guests come, they drink oil tea with the guests themselves, and oil tea has become an indispensable drink for entertaining guests. Locals believe that oil tea has many effects such as eliminating miasma, eliminating wind, refreshing the spirit, detoxifying, appetizing, and nourishing the skin. In the early morning, it can satisfy hunger and thirst, and at night it can improve energy and nourish the spirit; in the hot summer, it can relieve heat and heat, and in the severe winter it can remove dampness and cold; it can increase strength and endure labor before work, relax the body and relax the energy during work, and eliminate fatigue after work. \n\n\n\n\nThe way to inherit the custom of oil tea is group inheritance. Local people learn how to make oil tea from families, neighbors, and relatives and friends in their lives. The oil tea in Chengbu Miao Township was produced based on the living environment and living conditions of the Miao ancestors. It is the crystallization of the collective wisdom of the Miao people and the remains of tea culture. At present, some Miao family members have introduced oil tea into the market and opened oil tea shops to get rich, which has promoted the development of this custom. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Chengbu Miao Autonomous County Cultural Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nLiu Renxiu is preparing oil tea\n\n\n\n\nLiu Renxiu\n\n(March 1950 —) Female, Miao nationality, from Xiatuan Village, Dankou Town, Chengbu Miao Autonomous County, Hunan Province, and a representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of oil tea customs. \n\nShe was influenced by her mother-in-law and grandma's oil tea since she was a child. When she grew up, she inherited the skills of her mother-in-law's oil tea tea.

The Wugang braised dishes are mainly circulated in Wugang City, Hunan Province. \n\n\n\n\nWugang braised dishes have a long history. Legend has it that Lu and Hou of the Qin Dynasty lived in seclusion in Yunshan, Wugang. They used local ingredients, used secret recipes for palace diet, combined with alchemy recipes, and made unique braised dishes, which became the source of Wugang braised dishes. The production process of Wugang braised dishes is extremely particular: more than 20 pure Chinese herbal medicines such as fennel, cumin, cinnamon, diced cumin, star anise, etc. are used as braised ingredients, and the pig's tibia is made into thick soup and boiled into brine, which is a \"medicine braised\". Then put the braised products together with the braised Chinese herbal braised food, cook them over high heat for about half an hour, until they are 70% mature, take out the braised materials and braised products, drain the water and dry the shade, then put them in a thick soup with the braised materials, and simmer and torch them over low heat. Repeat this, at least three times, so that the braised taste slowly penetrates into the food. The more times the braised taste is, the purer the taste is, until the braised product is shiny and fragrant. The coloring of Wugang braised cuisine is made of caramel solution, that is, frying white sugar until melted and adding water. It does not use any pigments or food additives, so black or brown is the true color of Wugang braised cuisine. The finished braised flavors include more than 100 varieties, including braised tofu series, braised copper goose series, braised beef series, braised pork series, braised egg series, and more. \n\n\n\n\nWugang braised cuisine is produced in the form of a family workshop, which is generally a inheritance method taught by the father and son. After historical precipitation, traditional folk foods with strong local characteristics have been formed. Wugang braised cuisine has a unique taste and is famous for its flavor, delicious taste, sweetness and chewyness. It is a good product for home and travel. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Wugang Gudu Braised Vegetable Industry Co., Ltd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nThe inheritor Chen Fuyuan made braised dishes (photo by Yang Chunhui)\n\n\n\n\nChen Fuyuan\n\n(June 1956—) Male, Han nationality, from Wugang City, Hunan Province, representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of Wugang braised cuisine. \n\nSince the 1970s and 1980s, he learned his ancestral braised art with his father Chen Fuqing. In 1986, he inherited his manga and devoted himself to the management of Wugang braised cuisine. In order to enable Wugang braised cuisine to maintain the local specialty flavor and adapt to the trend of the times, we often travel to and from Hunan Agricultural University, Shaoyang College and other units to ask experts and professors for advice, and constantly innovate. Since 2001, the products it developed have won the \"Gold Award of the Hunan Agricultural Expo and Trade Fair\", as well as the \"Gold Award of the China Hunan Animal Husbandry and Fisheries and Feed Industry Expo\", and the \"Gold Award and Innovation Award of the China Braised Cuisine Capital Evaluation Competition\". The hand-pulled braised tofu dried tofu developed in 2007 filled the gap in the hand-pulled series in domestic soy products. He is currently the president of the Wugang Braised Cuisine Association. The Wugang Braised Cuisine Training Institute was established in 2016, which promoted the inheritance and development of Wugang Braised Cuisine production skills."

    "description-en": "\"Safety\" in the Yau Dance Drum Altar of the Badong Yao tribe\n\n\n\n\nThe Badong Yao ethnic drum dance altar is also known as \"Sacrifice of Bamboo King\" and \"Drum Beating Altar\", and the local Yao language is called \"Tan Sa Altar\", which is an ancient and mysterious sacrificial activity. It is mainly circulated among the Yao people in Malin, Huangjin Yao Township, Xinning County, Hunan Province and the surrounding eight caves (i.e. Malindong, Huangbudong, Luraodong, Shenchongdong, Taopendong, Chapingdong, Zhenyuandong, Dajuandong). \n\n\n\n\nAccording to the \"Baoqingfu Chronicle\" compiled in the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty, during the Shaoxing period of the Song Dynasty, a group of survivors from the ancient Yelang Kingdom traveled to Yizhou, Guangxi through Liping, Guizhou, and came to the Badong of Xinning through Hunan to settle down. They called themselves \"Ali people\" and passed on the custom of ancient Yelang's sacrifice to the bamboo king from generation to generation until today. The \"Wugang Prefecture Chronicles·Yao Vu\" compiled in the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty records: \"The god Jade-faced Heavenly Venerable, admired by the Yao people in the Badong, is the Bamboo King.\" In the late Qing Dynasty and early Republic of China, the custom of \"a small sacrifice for three years, one large sacrifice for seven years, one large sacrifice for three days, and one large sacrifice for seven days.\" The sacrificial process of the seven days and seven nights of the drum dance altar includes procedures such as \"declaration of the imperial list\", \"establishing the altar\", \"drinking the drum dance altar\", \"going to my parents' home\", \"receiving the three disasters\", \"anlong god\", \"respect the king of pan\", \"singing the song meeting\", \"removing the altar to send the gods\". Especially the \"drum dance hall\" on the third day and the third night is the key, and it is divided into five stages: Dongqing, Nanxing, Zhongpan, North Gang, and West Gang. The main god worshipped at the Yai tribe's drum dance altar in the Badong Yao tribe was not the common ancestor of the Yao tribe, King Pan, but the Yelang Bamboo King. King Pan was just one of the gods who enjoyed incense on the altar when worshiping the Bamboo King, and was ranked behind Nuo Gong Nuo Mu, Meishan Dong King, and Sandong Barbarian King on the altar. The gods worshipped by the Drum Dance Altar are all primitive gods whose divinity is mixed with human nature and animal nature, showing the ancient Yelang culture characteristics of the Drum Dance Altar. The sacrificial content and sacrificial forms of the Badong Yao ethnic group dance drum altar showcases the rich and colorful folk customs such as the creation of the heavens and earth, the origin of man and man, the migration of national affairs, historical events, production and life, and the song of human and gods. It is an invisible bond to inspire the national spirit, gather national strength, and enhance national unity. \n\n\n\n\nThe Eight-Dong Yao tribe's Drum Dance Altar is inherited by the Palm Master. The Palm Master is in charge of the sacrificial tools, spells and talismans for sacrifices. When he is old and unable to control the altar, he can only pass on the magic weapons and the magic of sacrifices to his most trusted disciples. The Badong Yao tribe only has language and no writing. The inheritance of the drum dance hall is entirely due to oral teaching between masters and apprentices. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Xinning County Cultural Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nQin Gang at the \"Safety\" ceremony\n\n\n\n\nQin Gang\n\n(August 1972 -) Male, Yao ethnic group, from Huangcha Village, Huangjin Yao ethnic township, Xinning County, Hunan Province, and a representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of Panwangjie (Badong Yao ethnic dance drum hall). \n\nAt the age of 8, he began to learn witchcraft and sacrificial rituals with Qin Yuxiu, the great master of the Dance Drum and Applause. At the age of 26, he became a wizard when he threw the card and passed the Dharma. During this period, he participated in large-scale local sacrificial activities. In 2004, he co-hosted the first \"Drum Jumping Altar\" celebration event in Badong Yaoshan with his master Qin Yuxiu. In 2006, he served as the master of the altar and was in charge of the sacrificial ceremony of the \"Badong Yao Tribe Dance Drum Altar\" in 2009. Qin Gang mastered a complete set of sacrificial rituals for the Bdong Yao ethnic drum dance altar, which can independently and completely reproduce the traditional rituals of the Bdong Yao ethnic drum dance altar, holding three clear turns, robes, water purification clothes, card printing belts, pressing plates, master swords, master guards, imperial decrees, horse whip belts, bells, general sages, tent edges, tables and other magical tools. The inherited books include \"Sitting in the Capital\", \"The Dharma of Meishan\" \"The Small Mountain Plan\", \"The First Year of the Dragon and Han Dynasty\", \"The Record of the Bamboo King\", etc."

    "description-en": "Keel waterwheel is an indispensable agricultural tool for traditional farming\n\n\n\n\nKeel water truck, commonly known as \"keel car\", is also known as \"overturning\", \"water truck\", \"water centipede\" and \"water dragon\". It is a farm tool that uses sprockets to continuously and quickly push low water to high places. Its production skills are now mainly circulated in Shaoyang City, Hunan Province, and have been distributed in rural areas across the province. \n\n\n\n\nSince its invention and finalization in the late Eastern Han Dynasty, the basic model of the keel waterwheel has not changed. The reason why it is called a keel water wheel is that it is because this water wheel is composed of wooden chains and scrapers one by one, shaped like a human spine (keel). It flips up and down when working like a dragon to draw water; the second is that it can use several or even hundreds of these water wheels to carry out traffic flow at the same time while staging the steps. The overall arrangement from bottom to top is like a giant dragon, so it is called a keel water wheel. The keel water truck has been manually completed from preparing materials to making it into a water truck. The logs used in processing and production are naturally generated, and materials are prepared by cutting, sun drying, air-drying, etc. The paint is made of natural tung seed oil in a pottery pot on a charcoal fire. The keel water wheel consists of four parts: the body, sheep claw blade, the head wheel, and the arm pedal wheel. Among them, the body of the car is made of three whole piece of oil fir boards, about 12 or 15 ft, one foot high, five inches wide and six inches high, and the trough is divided into two layers with a fir water board; the \"sheep claws\" and \"car leaves\" are cut directly with an axe, and the car leaves can generally be cut into leaves with a thickness of 3 minutes in the middle and 1 minute in the four sides. After the 68 (or 83) sheep claws connected to form a keel bone are cut with an axe, the front and back error of the teething clamps shall not exceed 1 mm. The upper and lower gears are the heart of the water wheel. The size, number of wheel teeth, and length are determined by artists based on experience. \n\n\n\n\nKeel waterwheel has played a huge role in the history of agricultural paddy fields in the south and is an ancient practical scientific product for agricultural production. The keel waterwheel production skills are passed down from generation to generation by family and master. The keel waterwheel has advanced design and complex technology, and contains rich agricultural science and technology genes. It has always been an indispensable and important tool in the production and life of farmers, especially farmers in hilly and mountainous areas. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Shaoyang Intangible Cultural Heritage Protection and Inheritance Research Institute\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZhang Yumin\n\n(July 1959 -) Male, Hui nationality, from Pingfeng Village, Shiqiao Township, Shuangqing District, Shaoyang City, Hunan Province, representative inheritor of provincial intangible cultural heritage of agricultural tools making skills (keel waterwheel making skills). \n\nAfter graduating from junior high school in 1975, his son inherited his father's business and went to the Shaoyang Wood Factory Keel Water Truck Branch to work as an apprentice, and followed his father Zhang Zheng Middle School to build a Keel Water Truck.

It integrates the essence of Tai Chi, Xingyi, Bagua and many other martial arts into one furnace, and compares the theoretical essence of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, and medicine. It mainly consists of seven-step exercises such as standing, testing force, friction steps, pushing hands, exerting force, testing sound, and practical practice.

There are no moves or methods in the original fighting. The routine was created after the needs of performance. It is far from the spirit of boxing and will hinder and restrict the human instincts. Dachengquan has good health and fitness value and focuses on spiritual exercise. It emphasizes the cultivation of human energy and spirit through thought induction in the process of natural cultivation, and opposes the integration of brute force and clumsy force, and the integration of nourishment and training to restore human body functions. Dachengquan emphasizes comfort and nature, and opposes barely engaging in overload exercise. It regards exercise and rest as one thing. At the same time, it believes that exercise itself is a kind of active rest. Dachengquan uses the cultivation methods closely linked to Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism and medical theories to promote the level of cultivation and improve the spiritual realm. Using Zen Buddhism to enter concentration and produce wisdom and nourish the mind, using Taoism to enter concentration and cultivate the nature, using Confucianism to be impartial and obedient, and using the middle to cultivate virtue, and using the doctors to cultivate the body and mind to cultivate life, to achieve the state of \"cloud, broad, vast, empty and selfless\". \n\n\n\n\nIn order to promote the inheritance and development of Dachengquan, the local area established the Shaoyang Zhongnan Wushu School and built the Dachengquan Training Center, actively cultivated coaches and students to enable its protection and inheritance to enter a new stage. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Shaoyang Zhongnan Wushu School\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZhang Liyi\n\n(April 1951—) Male, Han nationality, from Jianshan Village, Datian Township, Wugang City, Hunan Province, and a representative inheritor of Dachengquan's provincial intangible cultural heritage.\n\nHe came from a martial arts family and practiced martial arts since he was a child.

It is mainly circulated in Beita District, Daxiang District and Shuangqing District of Shaoyang City, Hunan Province. \n\n\n\n\nBaoqing porcelain engraving originated from the ancient \"peeled jade\" and \"number bowls\". It is a traditional handicraft of folk artists using special knives to carve various patterns and images on the surface of glazed and fired plain porcelain. Since it was spread to Baoqing area in the 12th year of Tongzhi in the Qing Dynasty (1873), it has been passed down for 5 generations. The artist first draws the ink draft of flowers, birds, insects, fishes, or landscape characters with a pen on various plain porcelains. Then, based on the ink drafts or lines, use a small wooden hammer to hit the tungsten steel knife to form an arrangement of points of different sizes, density and depth on the surface of the porcelain to form the picture or font to be represented; then use a diamond knife to carve along the outer contour of the picture or font, use double lines to express the picture or font, and then scrape off the glaze between the two lines. The surface of black porcelain does not need to be colored, and the color of glaze and the white of the porcelain body are used to form black, white and gray with different depths of the picture. After carving, white porcelain should be filled with ink and colored according to the creative concept, polished and waxed. Baoqing porcelain engraving integrates porcelain firing art with calligraphy and painting art and carving techniques. It uses porcelain engraving techniques such as gossilhouette point knife technique, random knife technique, and hoist knife technique and special techniques such as engraving, chiseling, stopping, dot, rushing, and opening to cleverly combine the brush and ink, charm, ethereality of Chinese paintings with dots, lines and surfaces of Western paintings. It not only has the wonderful ink and ink of brush and ink, the crystal clearness of ceramic art, but also has the majestic marks of knife engraving and the charm of gold and stone. \n\n\n\n\nBaoqing porcelain carving forms different artistic images through the changes of dots and lines.

In 1989, Zhang Mingwen, a master of porcelain engraving in the North School, learned porcelain engraving skills. In his many years of porcelain engraving career, he creatively connected Chinese painting and porcelain engraving, using porcelain as paper, knife and drill instead of pen, and using super realistic techniques to create a more complex \"gospring point knife method\" carving and engraving method, and carved many porcelain engraving works with rich layers, strong texture, revealing fine lines, and both form and spirit. His works \"Picture of Jobs\" and \"Flowers in Swimming\" won the gold medal in the \"Hundred Flowers Cup\" exhibition of Chinese Arts and Crafts Masters twice.

Hengshan Flower Drum Lantern originated during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty and was formed in the middle of the Qing Dynasty. Performed in Hengshan dialect. The musical instruments use Hengshan earthen pole suona and locally made bamboo tubes and huqins. Although the music and vocal system cannot be separated from the gong and drum suona brand, Sichuan tune and silk string minor tune, it focuses more on the silk string minor tune and gong tune. The tunes such as \"Siping Tent\" and \"One Pond of Clear Water and One Pond of Lotus\" are refined from Hengshan folk songs; \"Sparrow Song\" and the accompaniment music \"Ba Mozi\" are unique to Hengshan Flower Drum Lanterns; \"Hengshan Three Tunes\" and \"Hengshan Ai Tunes\" have unique charms and stronger local colors. In terms of performance, there are some more distinctive performance forms, such as the red silk dance in the \"Bench Hall Flower Drum\", playing with handkerchiefs, playing fans, and shuttled on the bench, as well as the shadow puppet movements in \"Double Picking Lotus\", the ventriloquism in \"Battle Spots\", the juggling in \"Battle Shoots\", the play money, playing spoons, cups, etc. in \"Escape from the Water Waste\". There are more than 150 traditional repertoires, including 86 small repertoires, 28 medium repertoires, and 19 large repertoires. The script is easy to understand and uses local accents in mixed language. The current stage of Hengshan County’s professional theater troupes generally uses Changsha dialect, while the ugly movements are still mainly based on Hengshan dialect. The performances should be mainly young actors, young actresses and clowns, and the ugly behavior is especially the first among the \"three small\" industries. Hengshan Flower Drum Lantern is a microcosm of local traditional folk culture and has a high status in the minds of local people. Doing a good job in protecting and rescuing Hengshan Flower Drum Lanterns will help promote the spiritual civilization construction in Hengshan County and have far-reaching significance for enriching and improving the history of local drama and local folk art.

    "description": "\n\n王理亮在石工劳动中收集、传唱劳动号子\n\n\n\n\n石马江劳动号子是一种与生产劳动密不可分的山歌型号子，集民间音乐、舞蹈和劳动技艺为一体，主要流传于湖南省新邵县及附近受梅山文化影响的地区。 \n\n\n\n\n石马江源于隆回县，流经新邵县的迎光、小塘等五个乡镇，在新田铺大禹庙村注入资江。全长虽仅百余公里，却因流经雪峰山脉，两岸多崇山峻岭。沿江百姓自古以农、牧和渔猎为生，自明朝至今，石马江畔百姓多以采石为业，鼎盛时期几乎村村户户皆有石工。石马江号子深受“梅山文化”的熏陶和影响，大量借鉴了梅山歌谣丰富的元素。其类型主要可分为石工号子和渔歌号子两大类。其中，石工号子以高亢粗犷的声腔为主，又分长号、短号、急号三类。长号用于拉石头，短号用于撬石头，急号用于抬石头上坡过坳。渔歌号子则以抒情柔美的声腔为主。此外，还有一些从石马江号子里演变出来的龙灯歌、打铁歌、儿歌和朝圣唱的南岳歌。其中，朝圣歌类似于石工号子；打铁歌则由于口语化而更像儿歌；龙灯歌接近于渔歌。石马江劳动号子一般由人嗓清唱，无任何乐器的伴奏。只有演唱龙灯歌的时候，才有一些简单的吹打乐器伴奏。石马江的民间龙灯舞堪称全国唯一使用民歌号子的龙灯舞蹈，表演起来有歌有舞，歌声雄壮、舞蹈有力，扣人心弦。石马江劳动号子的歌唱方式主要是“领、和”式，即一人领唱，众人和唱，或众人领唱，众人和唱。领唱者往往就是集体劳动的指挥者。领唱部分常常是唱词的主要陈述部分，其音乐比较灵活自由，曲调和唱词常有即兴变化，旋律常上扬，或比较高亢嘹亮，有呼唤、号召的特点；和唱部分大多是衬词或重复领唱中的片段唱词，音乐较固定，变化少，节奏感强。石马江劳动号子声腔分平腔、花腔、高腔三种，调式以羽、徴为主。尚存的曲牌有【太阳号子】【开台号子】【索拉号子】【琴石号子】【三声喂号子】等30余种。石马江劳动号子的演唱风格粗犷泼辣，激越诙谐，在表达上野蛮、大胆、任性，具有原始的野性美。 \n\n\n\n\n石马江劳动号子通过放歌的形式，讲述着千百年来石马江流域的人们开山破石的劳动故事、生产劳动知识、风土人情，同时也宣传伦理道德、歌颂男女情爱等，是石马江畔劳动人民智慧的结晶。 \n\n\n\n\n项目保护单位：新邵县文化馆\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n传承人：\n\n\n\n\n王理亮教谢春华唱劳动号子\n\n\n\n\n王理亮\n\n（1939年8月—）男，汉族，湖南省新邵县新田铺镇发冲村人，石马江劳动号子的省级非物质文化遗产代表性传承人。\n\n20世纪50年代开始，他在生产劳动中与本家的爱石匠、三石匠等前辈边干石工活边学喊石工号。后在修拦河坝、修公路的工程建设中，与石马江的名石匠张大求、张名寿、五牛里、王香保学习石工技艺、喊石工号子。1958年他进入新田铺镇文化站工作至1999年退休，先后担任该镇文化站辅导员、站长。五十年如一日，始终坚持深入基层，协助和辅导各村创办民间乐队、村业余剧团等文艺团队，培育农村文艺骨干，利用节假日举办文艺汇演和文体比赛来活跃群众的文化生活。特别是他坚持挖掘、收集、整理了大量的石马江劳动号子和石马江民间故事，还积极创作了100多个文艺作品，其中戏剧作品10余个、表演唱50余个，相声小品等30余个。省、市刊物和演出团体曾多次采用他的作品。创作的石马江石工号子表演唱节目多次参加县市艺术节。他还致力于带徒授艺，努力将传承了数百年的石工号子传承给下一代。",

    "description-en": "Wang Liliang collects and sings the labor horns in masonry labor\n\n\n\n\nShimajiang Labor Title is a folk song model that is inseparable from production labor. It integrates folk music, dance and labor skills. It is mainly circulated in Xinshao County, Hunan Province and nearby areas affected by Meishan culture. \n\n\n\n\nShima River originated in Longhui County, flowed through five townships including Yingguang and Xiaotang in Xinshao County, and was injected into Zijiang in Xintianpu Dayu Temple Village. Although the total length is only more than 100 kilometers, it flows through the Xuefeng Mountains, and there are many mountains and steep on both sides. Since ancient times, the people along the river have made a living by agriculture, animal husbandry, fishing and hunting. Since the Ming Dynasty, most people on the Shima River have been quarrying. During their heyday, almost every household in every village has stonework. Shimajiang's title is deeply influenced and influenced by \"Meishan Culture\" and has borrowed a lot of elements of Meishan's songs. Its types can be mainly divided into two categories: stoneworking and fisherman songs. Among them, the stoneworking phone number is mainly composed of high-pitched and rough voice, and is divided into three categories: trombone, shorter, and urgent one. The trombone is used to pull stones, the short trumpet is used to pry stones, and the urgent trumpet is used to lift stones uphill and cross the valley. Fisherman's song slogans mainly focus on lyrical and gentle voice. In addition, there are some dragon lantern songs, iron sings, children's songs and pilgrimage songs that evolved from the Shimajiang horn. Among them, the pilgrimage song is similar to the masonry horn; the ironwork song is more like a nursery rhyme due to colloquialization; the dragon lantern song is similar to the fisherman's song. The Shimajiang labor horn is generally sung by a man's voice, without any instrumental accompaniment. Only when singing the Dragon Lantern Song can there be some simple instrumental accompaniment. The folk dragon lantern dance in Shimajiang is the only dragon lantern dance in the country that uses folk songs. It is performed with songs and dances, with majestic singing and powerful dances, which are heart-wrenching. The main singing style of the labor horn in Shimajiang is the \"leading and harmony\" style, that is, one person leads the singing, everyone sings, or everyone leads the singing, everyone sings. The lead singer is often the conductor of collective labor. The lead part is often the main statement part of the lyrics. The music is more flexible and free. The tunes and lyrics often change improvisationally, the melody is often raised, or it is loud and loud, with the characteristics of calling and calling; the reciprocating part is mostly lyrics or repeated lyrics in the lead. The music is relatively fixed, with fewer changes and a strong sense of rhythm. The vocal cavity of Shimajiang labor horn is divided into three types: flat cavity, flower cavity and high cavity, and the mode is mainly feather and pine. There are more than 30 types of music cards that still exist, including [Sun Speaker] [Sola Speaker] [Qinshi Speaker] [Three Sound Feeder]. The singing style of Shimajiang Labor Call is rough and bold, exciting and humorous, and it is barbaric, bold and willful in its expression, with primitive wild beauty. \n\n\n\n\nThrough the form of singing, the Shimajiang Labor Call tells the labor stories, production of labor knowledge, customs and customs of the people in the Shimajiang River Basin for thousands of years. It also promotes ethics and morality, praises the love between men and women, etc. It is the crystallization of the wisdom of the working people on the Shimajiang River. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Xinshao County Cultural Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nWang Liliang teaches Xie Chunhua to sing the labor horn\n\n\n\n\nWang Liliang\n\n(August 1939 —) Male, Han nationality, from Fachong Village, Xintianpu Town, Xinshao County, Hunan Province, and a representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of Shimajiang Labor Tiezi.\n\nSince the 1950s, he learned to call out the masonry number with his predecessors such as his family's love stonemason and three stonemason in production labor. Later, during the construction of river dams and road construction projects, he learned stonework skills with famous stonemasons Zhang Daqiu, Zhang Mingshou, Wuniuli and Wang Xiangbao from Shimajiang and called the stonework. In 1958, he joined the Xintianpu Town Cultural Station and retired in 1999. He served as the counselor and webmaster of the town's cultural station. For fifty years, we have always insisted on going deep into the grassroots, assisting and tutoring various villages to establish folk bands, village amateur theater troupes and other literary and artistic teams, cultivating rural cultural and artistic backbones, and using holidays to hold cultural and artistic performances and cultural and sports competitions to activate the cultural life of the masses. In particular, he insisted on excavating, collecting and organizing a large number of Shimajiang labor vocabulary and Shimajiang folk stories, and actively created more than 100 literary and artistic works, including more than 10 drama works, more than 50 performances and singing, and more than 30 crosstalk sketches. His works have been adopted by provincial and municipal publications and performance groups many times. The Shimajiang Shigong Hazi created the performance and singing program participated in county and city art festivals many times. He is also committed to teaching skills by his apprenticeship, and strives to pass on the stoneworking phone that has been passed down for hundreds of years to the next generation."

The diagnosis and treatment techniques of Sun's bone correction surgery are mainly about \"both body and spirit\", \"overall treatment\", \"regulating muscles and bones\", \"discriminating and treating the stage\", \"compatibility and doing\", \"all techniques are formed together\", \"blood and water are stasis and water are stasis and intertwined\", \"blood and poison are intertwined\", and \"phlegm and blood are stasis and stasis are choked\", emphasizing \"one to protect life, two to restore body structure, three to restore function\", and are divided into four steps: injury detection, bone correction, fixation, and restoration of energy. \"Inspect injury\" mainly depends on looking, asking, hearing, and touching; \"bone correction\" is divided into three steps: tendon correction, reorganization and fixing, and there are 11 bone correction techniques such as \"extraction and pulling, lifting and pressing, and touching and top compression\", 8 upward techniques such as \"pulling and pulling, shaking and unlocking, rotary prying and resetting\", and 9 reinforcement techniques such as \"straightening method, pinching and elastic method, flexion and stretching and pulling\", and \"fixation\" based on the principle of \"stability, toughness, convenience, and convenience\", using cloth, wooden board, fir bark plywood, hard Materials such as cardboard have improved the design of splints based on traditional splint fixation, invented heel splints for calf fractures, stent splints for humeral shaft fractures, system splints for forearm fractures, and hooked external fixation stents for femoral trochanteric fractures; on the basis of the \"∞\" bandage, shoulder and arm bands were invented, and the fixation method of clavicle fractures was improved; for unstable long bone fractures, percutaneous needle threading and external fixation of splints were advocated. \"Reenergy\" mainly involves medicine, exercise and psychological treatment. The use of medicines emphasizes \"breaking, revitalizing, nourishing, combining and guiding\". The medicine is a Chinese herbal medicine collected from Longshan and surrounding areas. It includes more than 40 ancestral proven prescriptions and special preparations with significant efficacy, including \"Qiwei Jinhuang San\", \"Prescriptions for upper limb injury No. 1-3\", \"Prescriptions for lower limb injury No. 1-3\", \"Chest injury Series\", \"Starting injury Series\", \"Spinal injury Series\", \"Spinal injury Series\", \"Bleeding Paste\", \"Xiaoxue San\", \"Hearing Pain Capsules\", \"Bone Essence Capsules\", \"Bleeding Capsules\", \"Zhuanggu Capsules\". There are 125 exercise methods for practicing qigong, including dance, guidance, long fist, joint exercise, etc.\n\nWhen Sun's bone correction technique was first established, it was mainly secretly passed down between family and disciples. In the process of master-apprentice inheritance, we attach importance to traditional etiquette and can only become formal disciples through the apprenticeship ceremony. Sun's bone correction technique has now begun to be taught publicly and has gradually transformed into a inheritance system that combines master-apprentice teaching with school education. The Sun family's bone correction technique in Xinshao organically integrates the mysterious traditional folk bone correction technique in Hunan with modern bone correction technique, which has high reference value for studying Hunan culture, traditional medical skills in Meishan area, and enriching my country's traditional bone correction technique.\n\nProject protection unit: Xinshao County Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital\n\n\n\n\nThe third-generation inheritor Sun Guangsheng and the fourth-generation inheritor Nie Zhaowen performed a technique to repair the fracture\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nLiao Huaizhang\n\n(December 1964—) Male, Han nationality, from Xinshao County, Hunan Province, chief physician, expert of special allowance from the State Council, and representative inheritor of national intangible cultural heritage of traditional Chinese medicine bone correction therapy (Xinshao Sun's bone correction technique).

He learned from Sun Guangsheng, the third-generation successor of Xinshao Sun's bone correction technique. He not only learned all the true skills of Sun's bone correction and healing injuries, but also actively studied modern medical science, connecting Chinese and Western medicine, learning from others' strengths, boldly introduced modern bone injury techniques such as open reduction surgery and internal fixation to treat severely displaced intraarticular fractures, open fractures, and old fractures, and proposed the theory of bone injury correction and treatment of \"both body and spirit, overall adjustment, muscle correction and bone correction, and period and position diagnosis and treatment\". He has always served as the leader of the Sun's orthopaedic research discipline. With the support of Sun Guangsheng, he comprehensively and systematically summarized and organized the Sun's orthopaedic surgery from bone injury theory, clinical treatment, and prescription combination. He used the traditional orthopaedic therapy of Sun's orthopaedic surgery to carry out a number of high-difficulty orthopedic treatment surgeries and treatment studies. He has published more than 20 papers on the application of Sun's orthopaedic surgery and has achieved many national and provincial scientific research results.

Tantou Town is located in the southeast of Longhui County, Hunan Province. The folk customs here are simple and honest, and the customs are unique. In history, there have been papermaking villages, carving villages, colored paper, flower paper, fragrant powder paper alleys and New Year painting streets. The handicraft industry is very developed, and the division of labor is clear and they are matched with each other. Since ancient times, the witch style of the beach has been prosperous, and folk sacrificial activities have been very popular. There are many varieties of paper horses used for sacrifices. The production process has an inherent inheritance relationship with the later wooden New Year pictures of the beach. According to the \"Longhui County Chronicles\", the wooden New Year paintings in the Taiwan Tou have a history of more than 300 years. According to oral historical materials among the people, the original wooden New Year painting workshop in the Taiwan Tou was run by Wang Dongyuan, nicknamed \"Wang Monkey\" in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. It has printed more than ten kinds of New Year paintings, including \"Qin Shubao\" and \"Yuchi Gong\". During the Daoguang period, Hu Qifu opened the \"Heshunchang\" New Year painting workshop, adding new varieties such as \"Taoyuan Joy\". During the Tongzhi period, the wooden New Year pictures in the Taiwan Tou were sold nationwide. At the beginning of the 20th century, the production of wooden New Year paintings in the Taiwan Tou reached its peak, with 108 New Year painting workshops, with an annual output of more than 30 million New Year paintings, sold to various provinces in Jiangnan and Southeast Asia. After 1949, the wooden New Year paintings on the beach were banned as feudal superstitions. Production was resumed in 1958, destroyed again after 1966, and resumed production in 1979. In 1984, Tantou Town was named \"The Hometown of Modern Folk Painting in China\" by the Ministry of Culture. In 1994, the wooden New Year painting of the Taiwan Tou was awarded the \"Single Silver Award for Chinese Folk Art\" by the Ministry of Culture. In 2003, at the first exhibition of cultural relic imitations and folk crafts, the wooden New Year painting of the Beachtou won the Gold Award for Traditional Chinese Crafts.\n　　\n\n\n\n\nAll processes from papermaking to finished products in the beach head woodblock New Year paintings are completed locally in the beach head, forming a complete production series, which is rare in the production of New Year paintings across the country. There are more than 40 varieties of traditional wooden New Year paintings in the beach, divided into three categories: door god portraits, auspicious meanings, and opera stories. In the process of wooden wooden New Year paintings in the beach, traditional processes such as steaming paper, stenting glue, and brushing powder are all unique to beach, and \"opening faces\" is also a unique skill that is different from other New Year paintings. The difficulty of making plates in the wooden New Year pictures in the beach lies in the line carving. In this regard, the \"steep knife and line-standing\" technology of the \"Gao Fuchang\" New Year painting workshop is very famous. It has the same angle of the knife and uses uniform dark force. The turning points and intersections are stable and unchaotic, and it is completely grasped by feeling and skills.\n　　\n\n\n\n\nToday, the wooden New Year pictures of the beach head, which have been in the style for more than 300 years, have traveled across the ocean and become a collection of large museums in many countries such as Britain, the United States, and Japan. However, in recent years, the market for woodblock New Year paintings in the Taiwan Tou has shrunk sharply, and the workshops are not enough to make ends meet. Artists have changed their careers one after another, and only two New Year painting workshops still retain their storefronts. Among them, \"Jinyumei\" has basically stopped production, and \"Gao Lamei\" can only barely support it. The annual output is less than 50,000 pieces, and none of the children of the workshop owners have inherited their ancestral property. The wooden New Year pictures in the beach head may be destroyed or lost, and many skills have been lost and need to be rescued and protected urgently.\n　　\n\n\n\n\nRelated inheritors\n\n\n\n\nLiu Guoli, male, Han nationality, traditional art, VII-8, Taiwan Wooden New Year Pictures, Longhui County, Hunan Province\n\n\nZhong Jiantong, Male, Han nationality, Traditional Art, VII-8, Tantou Wooden New Year Pictures, Longhui County, Hunan Province\n\nLi Xianlu Male 1934.12 Traditional Art Ⅶ-8 Tantou Wooden New Year Pictures Longhui County, Hunan Province\n\nZhong Haixian   1928.10  Traditional art  VII-8  Tantou woodblock New Year painting  Longhui County, Hunan Province  \n\nGao Hanmei Female 1933.12 Han Nationality Traditional Art Ⅶ-87 Tantou Wooden New Year Pictures Longhui County, Hunan Province"

According to the \"Baoqingfu Chronicle\", there were dozens of workshops for processing and distributing feather paintings and crafts in Shizi Street, County West Street and Xiwai Street in Shaoyang City in the Ming Dynasty. In the early 1960s, the Shaoyang Institute of Arts and Crafts hired folk artist He Binyang to develop and restore the traditional feather painting technology. From the 1980s to 1990s, the Shaoyang Feather Painting Factory earned 20 million US dollars in exports. Feather painting has a unique craft. With the help of traditional Chinese painting techniques and expression techniques such as sculpture, woodcutting, and decorative techniques, it uses three techniques: flat pasting, semi-three-dimensional relief and three-dimensional relief, and is made through the design, depiction, feather selection, tailoring, pasting, mounting and other programs. It has rich colors, bright colors and never fades. Shaoyang feather paintings have scrolls, yarn linings, wall hangings and other varieties. The works are mostly themed on landscapes, flowers and birds, and landscapes. The scroll feather painting mainly absorbs the art form of Chinese landscape painting and is framed with silk. The yarn lining absorbs the form of Hunan embroidery with double-sided different color embroidery and can be appreciated on both sides. The wall-mounted art tapestry is made of layered feathers, which is especially suitable for expressing landscape scenery. Shaoyang Feather Painting is good at using the natural colors and textures of various feathers, emphasizing natural colors in terms of brightness and texture, giving people a natural beauty. The skills, techniques, styles and styles of Shaoyang feather painting have strong regional characteristics and charm. They are created and inherited by ordinary people based on their lives. They reflect the thoughts and interests of the local people, meet the spiritual and cultural needs of the people, and enrich the content of folk arts and crafts.

Puppets can be used to perform singing and dancing operas. The Song Dynasty was an important period in the development of puppet shows in my country, and the production and manipulation skills of puppets were further mature. With the development of social economy, puppet shows in the Ming Dynasty have become popular all over the country, and puppet shows in various economically developed southern provinces and regions have become more prosperous, so there is a saying that \"the south is good puppet\". After the Qing Dynasty, puppet shows entered its heyday. Not only were they popular in a wide range, but the voice of the performances also increased. Branches such as Liaoxi Puppet Show, Zhangzhou Puppet Show, Quanzhou Puppet Show, Jinjiang Puppet Puppet Show, Shaoyang Puppet Show, Gaozhou Puppet Show, Chaozhou Tiezhi Puppet Show, Sichuan Beida Puppet Show, Shiqian Puppet Show, Yangli Puppet Show, Taishun Yaofa Puppet Show, and Linggao Puppet Show. In terms of performance format, it can be summarized as five types: thread-carrying puppets, stick-headed puppets, cloth bag puppets, iron-branch puppets, and medicinal puppets.\n　　\n\nThe puppet art is exquisite and breathtaking. In addition to the wonderful performances of the artist, the perfect puppet plastic art and operating equipment are also an important aspect of attracting the audience. The art of modeling focuses on the carving and design of puppets. Generally speaking, the shape of a thread-lifting puppet is relatively high, mostly around 2.2 feet. Key parts are all equipped with lifting lines, up to 30, or at least more than ten. If you perform a stunt performance, you must add several auxiliary lifting lines as needed. The level of the puppet performing various dance postures and martial arts skills depends entirely on the artist's operating skills, which is the key to the level of the performing art of the puppet. The stick-headed puppet is higher than the thread-holding puppet. It is generally about 3 feet tall and is equipped with three operating lines. Two pulls hands and one controls the head and body to perform. The bag puppet has the smallest shape, only about 7 inches. It is supported by artists with both hands and performing. Its operating skills are special, unlike thread-lifting and stick-headed puppets.\n　　\n\nAfter the founding of the People's Republic of China, the performance of puppet shows became more colorful. In addition to performing traditional opera programs, he also performs dramas, musicals, TV series, and even acts in advertisements. At the same time, puppet shows are also facing fierce competition with other art forms. Traditional puppet shows contain the ideological, moral and aesthetic consciousness of people from all regions and nations, and should be supported and protected.\n　　\n\nYanwoling, Baizhu Village, the birthplace of Shaoyang puppet show, is located in Jiugongqiao Town, Shaoyang County. According to the Liu family genealogy, in the late Yuan Dynasty and early Ming Dynasty, in order to avoid war, the ancestor Shenggong of Liu and his family carried puppet show and fled to Bird's Nest Ridge to settle down, which has been more than 600 years since then. The puppet opera was passed down from Shenggong to the generation of \"Yong\", and a total of 18 generations.\n　　\n\nShaoyang puppet opera is an oral and heart-to-heart teaching. The performance method and performance skills are: an artist has a role to play, no matter big or small, literary or martial arts, Shengdan, Jingmo and Chou, playing, playing, playing, playing, singing, and playing, relying on the artist to use his hands, feet, mouth, and tongue together, and flexibly dispatch his ten fingers. The main plays include \"The Investiture of the Gods\", \"Romance of the Three Kingdoms\", \"Journey to the West\", \"Yang Xiao Fighting the Tiger\", etc., mostly martial arts, ghost dramas, and comic dramas. The music is mainly based on Qi Opera singing style, with a fresh, simple and innocent style, and it forms its own genre.\n　　\n\nShaoyang puppet opera combines puppet skills, drama forms, and performance skills, and has the characteristics of mystery, exquisiteness, novelty and simplicity. For more than 600 years, it has always maintained its performance skills, performance style and performance form from its early stages, with unique historical and cultural heritage, and has high aesthetic interests and value orientations. During its heyday, there were more than 110 operas on the Yeonwoling Mountain, including Yunnan, Guizhou, Huguang, and Zhejiang. In September 1956, artist Liu Henggui visited Czechoslovakia to perform the puppet drama \"Three Fights of the White Bone Spirit\" and achieved great success. Since its publicity by mainstream media such as CCTV in 2002, it has attracted attention at home and abroad. Especially in August 2005, CCTV Opera Channel broadcast a special program on Shaoyang puppet opera. Its unique artistic and cultural value attracted the attention and attention of relevant parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated inheritors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiu Yongzhang   Male  1942.05.14  Traditional Drama  Ⅳ-92  Puppet Show (Shaoyang Puppet Show)  Shaoyang County, Hunan Province  \n\n\nLiu Yongan   Male  1946.11.11  Traditional Drama  Ⅳ-92  Puppet Show (Shaoyang Puppet Show)  Shaoyang County, Hunan Province  "

The Yao folk songs have a variety of sentences such as five-character, seven-character, tune style, long and short sentences. The tunes are complex and the structure and form of the songs are diverse. These folk songs can be divided into love songs, custom songs, production songs, bitter songs, resistance and struggle songs, etc. according to the subject matter. Love songs can be divided into love songs, love songs, separation songs, love songs, love and hate songs, free songs, and pan songs.\nHuayao Wuwa Mountain Song is an ancient folk music art unique to the Huayao people. It has a history of thousands of years and is mainly circulated in the Huxingshan Yao Township, Longhui County, Hunan Province. Wuwa mountain song originated from the labor romance of Huayao's ancestors. After long-term development, it gradually formed a unique style and eventually evolved into a high-pronunciation mountain song. Its development history mainly includes the germination period of the ancestors' era, the incubation period of the late Yuan Dynasty and the early Ming Dynasty, and the maturity period from the Ming and Qing Dynasties to the Republic of China.\n　　\n\nHuayao Wuwa folk songs are based on production, life and folk legends. They can be roughly divided into four categories: historical songs, customs and exhortation songs, production and labor songs, and love songs are the most brilliant part of them. Huayao Wuwa folk songs are mostly sung by adult men in a combination of true and false voices. The music is adjusted freely, the sound is loud and loud, with a long swaying voice, and often mixed with the words \"wuwa\" and other lines.\n　　\n\n\n\n\nThe verses of Wuwa Mountain Song are relatively neat, usually seven-character, nine-character or eleven-character sentences are one sentence, each song has six lyrics, and generally double-character sentences are rhymes. The words and sentences often use direct statements, metaphor, excitement, duality, parallelism, repetition, question-and-answer sentences and other expression techniques. The rhyme of the Wuwa mountain song is called the tone. Each tone has a fixed name composed of three characters, which is similar to the name of the Qupai, which is not available in other mountain songs. According to research, Huayao Wuwa folk songs have 24 tunes, and now there are about a dozen of them, such as [Young Beloved], [My Brother], [My Sage], [Let’s Listen], etc.\n　　\n\nThe Wuwa folk song comprehensively and vividly reflects the life form and cultural tradition of Longhui Huayao, and its content is equivalent to the history of Huayao's growth. The high-pitched melody of this kind of mountain song is incomparable to other mountain songs. As music experts have evaluated, even the most famous singers in the world can find it difficult to sing the high notes of the wuwa mountain song. The \"Wuwa\" that penetrates the clouds and sky in the song symbolizes the tenacious spirit of the Huayao people to fight against the harsh environment. Even the pursuit of love is majestic and shaking, fully reflecting the firm, optimistic, sincere and enthusiastic national character of the Huayao people, and providing vivid examples for ethnology research. At present, not many older generation Huayao singers are alive, and the inheritance of Wuwa folk songs urgently needs to be solved.\n\n\n\n\nRelated inheritors\n\n\n\n\nDai Bisheng Male 1949.12 Traditional Music Ⅱ-110 Yao folk songs (Huayao Wuwa folk songs) Longhui County, Hunan Province"

Junshan Silver Needle is produced in Junshan Island, Dongting Lake, Yueyang City, Hunan Province. It is named after its white hair on the outer layer, its white hair is completely exposed and wrapped firmly, and the tea buds are like silver needles. It is also called \"Golden Inlaid Jade\". \n\n\n\n\nJunshan Yinzhen Tea production skills \"re-packing fermentation\"\n\n\n\n\nJunshan Yinzhen Tea is said to have been sown by Ehuang Nuying to take root and sprout. The production method was created by monks on Junshan Island. After thousands of years of circulation and preservation, a complete set of Junshan tea production skills have been formed. Among them, the \"double-type duplicate baking\" and \"double-type duplicate yellow\" that can obtain treasures in the mud and extract essence in the fermentation are important processes in which Junshan silver needle buds are golden, fresh and mellow and refreshing, and long aftertaste. There are strict requirements for the picking and making of Junshan silver needles, and the first tender buds of spring tea can only be picked seven to ten days before and after the Qingming Festival. There are the requirements of \"not picking on rainy days\", \"not picking on dew buds\", \"not picking on wind damage buds\", \"not picking on open buds\", \"not picking on purple buds\", \"not picking on hollow buds\", \"not picking on curved buds\", \"not picking on insect buds\", \"not picking on thin buds\", \"not picking on too long and short buds\", that is, \"nine no picking\". The length, width, width and thickness of the leaves are calculated in millimeters. One pound of silver needle tea requires about 40,000 tea buds. The production of Junshan Yinzhen Tea requires nine processes, including drying, finishing, cooling, initial baking, initial baking, re-drying, re-drying, re-drying, re-drying, full-fired, and selection. After the green leaves are removed from the pot, put them in a small bamboo tray, gently shake them several times, emit heat, and remove fine powder and miscellaneous pieces. Put it on the charcoal stove and bake it for a while until it is about 50%. Wrap it in kraft paper and place it in the box. When the buds turn yellow, they can be loose and baked again, and baked until 80% dry. The method of repacking is the same as that of the first bag. When the tea buds are golden in color and rich in aroma, it is moderate. Roast the foot heat until the foot dry. After processing, grade the buds according to their fat, straight, and bright and dark colors. The strong, straight and bright yellow are the best; the thin, curved and dark yellow are the second. \n\n\n\n\nJunshan Yinzhen Tea production skills are mainly inherited through master-apprentice inheritance and collective enterprise production. Junshan Yinzhen Tea has a clear aroma, a mellow and refreshing taste, a clear soup, and a strong bud. The buds are golden and shiny, with light yellow slim hairs, thick and evenly shiny bottoms, and the taste is sweet and sweet, and it will not change after a long time. After brewing, the buds are hung vertically in the soup and rush to the water surface, sinking slowly, rising and sinking again, three ups and three downs. Junshan Yinzhen has excellent color, fragrance, taste and shape. In addition to having high drinking value, it also has certain ornamental value. It is a treasure among Chinese tea. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Yueyang Junshan District Cultural Center"

The existing fine cultural relics such as \"green glaze knife-holding figurines\", \"green glaze human head and beast body figurines\", \"simple-fat Hu human figurines\", \"hu people leading camel maids\", and \"lei maids\" in cultural and museum institutions are all produced in Yuezhou kilns. Yuezhou Kiln has a large historical span. The Yangshahu Kiln in the upper reaches originated from the Eastern Han Dynasty to the prosperous Tang Dynasty. The Sanfeng Kiln and Wulong Kiln in the middle and lower reaches are still in constant kiln fire. The glaze color of the utensils fired by Yuezhou kiln is mainly green and translucent, and is mostly open. Due to air gaps at the bottom, golden crystals appear. It is because of the natural operation when glazeing. The glaze hangs like tears and is vivid and beautiful. Yuezhou kiln is environmentally friendly and non-toxic, and is widely used in people's daily lives. The products include bowls, plates, bowls, pots, and jars, water tanks and jars with covers or broken mouths, figurines, ox figurines, terracotta horses, lifelike gods, ghosts, Taoists and opera characters, as well as various toilets and urinals with strange shapes. People have always liked to use the lip jar of Yuezhou kiln to pickle various kimchi and pickled vegetables to strengthen the spleen and appetite, and never get bad for years. The \"ginger, salt, bean, sesame tea\" fried in brown tea pots and cans can not only strengthen the body and cure colds, but also fill the stomach, which is very water-climbing.

In summer, the food will not deteriorate for two or three days; in Yuezhou kiln teapots, they will not rot overnight, so they are deeply loved by the people. In the past, the firing skills of Yuezhou kilns were mainly inherited through family and master-apprentice methods, and now they are mainly inherited through school teaching methods. From the types of Yuezhou kilns and the fragments of the site excavated over the years, we can see the living form of people and their migration process at that time, as well as local environmental changes.

In 278 BC, the patriotic poet Qu Yuan threw himself into the Miluo River on the fifth day of the fifth lunar month and died for his country. According to Wang Jia of the Jin Dynasty, shortly after Qu Yuan jumped into the river, the Miluo people built Qu Yuan's former house in Nanyang as a temple, and held a grand sacrificial ceremony. This is the earliest folk sacrifice to Qu Yuan, which the locals call \"chao Temple\". Zhang Shao, the governor of Xiangzhou in the Southern Dynasty, sent \"Hucao Operator\" to Miluo to worship Qu Yuan, and set a precedent for the government's sacrifice. In the seventh year of Tianbao in the Tang Dynasty (748), the Qu Zi Temple was rebuilt, and local officials \"sacrificed for the year\" and were officially included in the sacrificial ceremony of the court. The Qu Zi Temple Festival has been passed down to this day, and the etiquette procedures have basically followed the Qing system. According to the \"Xiangyin County Chronicles\", on the fourth day of the fifth month of the Qing Dynasty, local officials went to the Miluo Jing Temple (clean), saved animals (slaughtered pigs and sheep), and performed three bows.

The main operating procedures in the pot include shaving hair, making hair, cutting hair, shaving hair, combing hair, etc. The maker needs to press the roots of the wool that are already arranged neatly on the plate with one hand and comb the wool with the bone comb in the other hand. After repeated many times, the peaks of the hairs are connected into neat pieces. Finally, use a characteristic knife to cut the tip of the hair, grab the tip of the hair, and use a bone comb to comb the hair until the broken hair inside is combed out, then put the pen on, and roll it skillfully, and the tip of the pen will first appear. The pen tip is naturally dried and glued to the pen holder. Then, use a pen sharpener to remove the miscellaneous hairs without peaks and use your hands to make it form. This process is called \"dou pen\". The Chuanshan brush pen holder is pure white, color or black, and the refined beef bones are used as top cover decoration. The pen tip is tender and white, the body is stable, the ink is moderate, the ink is evenly applied, and the writing is fluent and smooth. According to its structure and purpose, Sichuan Mountain brushes can be divided into two categories: sheep hair and wolf hair, 37 categories, including small regular script and medium regular script, and 184 varieties of special small regular script and double-material small regular script. The production of Sichuan Mountain brushes strictly follows the ancient methods, and the master passes them on the word of mouth to his disciples from generation to generation. Chuanshan brushes are exquisitely made and are well-known for their four major advantages: \"round, uniform, sharp and healthy\". It has been around for a long period of history and has been prosperous and has a reputation for its quality. Project protection unit: Miluo City Cultural Center"

Later, it borrowed the charcoal lanterns used to illuminate fish at night, which concentrated on the fishing and hunting culture of Meishan area. It originated from sacrificial rituals and later developed into an indispensable performance program in local weddings and funerals and various festive activities. Charcoal dance is generally carried out in conjunction with dragon dance activities, mainly used to open the way and illuminate the atmosphere. Generally, two people cooperate to perform. During the performance, fir cream or chestnut bark are placed in a small mesh cage made of iron wire, and then the wire cage is tied to the upper end of the bamboo pole with a brown rope. After the charcoal lamp is lit, the performer swings the 5-meter-long bamboo pole and lantern, using physical movements such as swing, throwing, circling, shaking, closing and lunge, big eight-character step, and squatting column. The dancer's dance posture is fierce and brave, and is strong and soft, with various postures and changes. The charcoal and sparks in the lanterns splash, like a dragon tumbling, like a red train galloping, dazzling people. The dancers on the ground and the charcoal flowers in the sky are integrated, which is extremely beautiful. The dance is accompanied by percussion music, and the music is cheerful and passionate and vigorous. The dance movements include \"snowflakes covering the top\", \"two dragons grab treasure\", \"eight-character back pattern\", \"sweeping lotus\", \"three incense sticks facing the sky\", etc. The dance performance content is divided into three categories: clan totem worship, folk stories, and folk life. As the charcoal flowers fly, the dragon lanterns and lions churn and jump in the rhythm of the gongs and drums, and the atmosphere is warm. Qijiang Charcoal Flower Dance is suitable for night performances, and can be performed on empty venues and on main roads. \n\n\n\n\nQijiang Charcoal Flower Dance was originally a unique heritage of the local Hu clan. It was mainly taught orally through the inheritance of masters and apprentices, and was continuously improved and updated by the descendants of the Hu clan. It organically combines dance with sacrifice, dance style and totem, making the performance extremely difficult. It vividly reflects the local cultural traditions and carries rich historical accumulation. It embodies the Meishan spirit of \"endurance, domineering, not be ruthless, and fighting to the death\", and has high historical and cultural value. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Longhui County Intangible Cultural Heritage Protection Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHu Guangdan\n\n(November 1947—) Male, Han nationality, from Qijiang Township, Longhui County, Hunan Province, and a representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of Qijiang Charcoal Flower Dance. \n\nIn 1962, after graduating from junior high school, he learned basic skills of charcoal dance with his father. The system has mastered traditional charcoal dance styles such as \"snowflakes cover the top\", \"two dragons grab treasure\", \"eight-character back pattern\", \"sweeping lotus\", \"three incense sticks facing the sky\". Later, in practice, the traditional charcoal dance was innovated from utensils to patterns, and created new styles such as \"nine chains\", \"one series\", \"chrysanthemums\", \"fairy scattering flowers\", \"nine dragons playing in the water\", and \"spring swallows soaring\". His Qijiang Charcoal Flower Dance is based on a charcoal lamp as the main body, and integrates the charcoal lamp, a dragon lamp and a lion.

    "description-en": "Yuezhou fan production skills are named after Yueyang is called Yuezhou in ancient times. They are mainly circulated in Yueyang County, Yueyang City, Hunan Province. There are still Yuezhou fan raw material production and processing bases in other districts and counties in Yueyang City and some districts and counties in Changde City. Yuezhou fan production skills have a long history. The \"Yuezhou Prefecture Chronicle·Food Records\" of Longqing of the Ming Dynasty recorded: \"There are some things...fans (many bones and light).\" It shows that by the Ming Dynasty, the Yuezhou fan production skills, mainly composed of many fracture fans, had reached a very high level. From the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China, Yueyang County's rich bamboo resources, fast water and land transportation and location advantages, Yuezhou's fan industry continued to develop, and at its peak, there were thousands of employees who made fan bones in Yueyang. Guangxu's \"Baling County Chronicles·Volume 52\" records: \"After the marriage in the county is scheduled to be hired... the girl's family uses purses, fan inserts, etc.,\" indicating that the popularity and use of Yuezhou fans among the people during this period. Yuezhou fans include folding fans, round fans, banana fans, feather fans, and central hall large hanging fans, especially folding fans. The finished folding fan is stumbled in a shuttle shape, with a tight mouth and a thin tail drum. The production skills are made of nanmu bamboo as the bones, cow bone as nails, and rice paper as the surface. The materials are exquisite and the craftsmanship is rigorous. There are two major procedures for the production of fan bones and fan surfaces, including 72 processes including \"saw barrel\", \"slicing\", \"thinning\", \"border bones pushing green\", \"small bones pushing green\", \"edge bones\", \"edge edges\", \"pulling tips\", \"sanding\", \"drilling the holes\", \"walls\", \"grabbing belts\", \"opening the chisels\", and \"tops\". Among them, the production and shape of fan bones are the key links of Yuezhou fan's most effective technical skills. They must go through multiple processes such as sawing, chopping, shaving, squashing, boiling, and drying. When making, they must be made into bamboo, and the heart and palm are sealed together, and carefully polished. The polished fan eyes look like jade and smooth when touching the hand. The fan pattern design is rich in imagination, extensive materials, and novel concepts, including landscapes, scenic spots, flowers, birds, insects and fish, famous quotes, historical figures, myths and legends, etc. Yuezhou fan production skills are mainly inherited through two ways: teacher education and family tradition. The inheritance is clear and can be traced back to the middle and late Qing dynasties. At present, through opening training classes, going to campus, and producing enterprises, a variety of inheritance methods such as education and social inheritance have been added.

Since the main area of ​​formation and popularity was the ancient Yuezhou Prefecture, it is also called \"Yuezhou Ban\" and \"Yueyang Opera\". In 1952, it was called Baling County because of Yueyang in ancient times, and the opera genre was first established as \"Baling Opera\". Baling Opera was formed from the localization of Kunqu Opera in the late Ming and early Qing dynasties. Its style is simple and rough, and it is appreciated by both the elite and the masses. It is mainly popular in the counties (cities) under the jurisdiction of Yueyang City today, as well as Tongcheng, Chongyang, Hubei, Xiushui, Tonggu and other counties in Jiangxi. It is one of the local operas that the people of Hunan have been popular with in the past 400 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBaling opera uses Zhongzhou rhyme and Huguang sound combined with Hunan dialect as its stage language. There are two sound cavity and mud cavity, and the main one is the spring cavity. Kunqu originated from Kunshan accent that was popular in the Ming Dynasty. Seven existing repertoires sung in Kunqu are \"Blessings of Heaven\" and \"Six Kingdoms Farewell Prime Ministers\". Some of the other repertoires are changed to Tanqui because of their elegant lyrics and slow rhythms. A large number of music cards are used in the performance show. The Tankun is the main vocal sensation of Baling Opera, belonging to the Pihuang Opera system, commonly known as the \"North and South Road\". \"South Road (Erhuang)\" originated from Anhui Hui dialect, and \"North Road (Xipi)\" originated from Western Qin Opera and Northern Qu. The singing style is basically the same as other types of skin yellow operas, but there are also many unique tone and styles, such as Xi Erhuang, South to North, North tone, South La North Singing, South One Character Ban, etc. Baling Opera not only made important contributions to the formation and development of Pihuang Opera, but was also recognized by opera historians as the \"center of gravity\" that influenced the formation of Han Opera. In 1960, he created [Baling Gaokong] again. Since Jiaqing in the Qing Dynasty, Baling opera has become a multi-vocal opera mainly based on the tand-tune opera.\n\n\n\n\nBaling Opera has a complete performance program, which is a special means to express stories and portray characters through singing and dancing. The division of professional labor is strict and meticulous. Most actors in various industries require comprehensive development of singing, doing, reciting and fighting. In modern times, they are especially famous for martial arts dramas in Hunan and Hubei. The performance program is rich, and the \"eight skills inside and outside\" are used as the main means to shape characters. The \"Eight Inner Kung Fu\" is commanded by \"eye method\". Although it is mainly summarized as eight basic skills of \"joy, anger, sorrow, joy, sorrow, sorrow, hatred, and shock\", there are more than 30 common eyes, which are techniques that must be mastered to portray the inner mental state of the characters and express the emotions of the characters. \"Eight External Techniques\": hands, legs, mouth, body, neck, martial arts, Taoism, and thorns, which are the use of external body shape and props to tread. The two closely combine to shape characters through the adjustment of \"floating, sinking, and spitting\". Singing skills emphasize \"the character is the bones and the flesh\", the character is the rhythm, and the character is the correct and round. Daobai pays attention to the whirlwind, whirlwind and spout, and pays attention to clear pronunciation and sends far and wide. Professional division of labor, actors are divided into three major industries: Sheng, Dan and Jing. Each major industry is divided into five small industries, a total of fifteen industries. Except for one of the major industries that can learn opera, most of the other twelve industries must not be stopped by civil and military officials, and they must be both sing and working. The staff have internal and external management teams, three boxes and six scenes (bands), three tea poles and four trunks, so as to form the basic team of the Baling Opera Jianghu class and tour them in cities and villages. In order to keep Baling Opera's artistic youth forever, in 2006, the State Council included it in the first batch of national-level representative protection projects for intangible cultural heritage. In 2011, in the tide of cultural system reform, the Yueyang Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government reorganized and rebuilt the Baling Drama Troupe, Huagu Drama Troupe and Song and Dance Troupe, established the \"Yueyang Baling Drama Inheritance Research Institute\" (Yueyang Art Theater), and conscientiously implemented various protection measures. In recent years, good shows have been happening and achieved remarkable results. Baling Opera will surely usher in a beautiful spring with blooming flowers.\n\n \n\n \n\n▲Baling opera's new historical drama \"Far from the Rivers and Lakes\"\n\n \n\n \n\n "

Among the many local operas in Hunan, Yueyang Huagu Opera is the most typical and unique opera. In 2007, Yueyang Huagu Opera was officially recognized by the State Council as the second batch of national intangible cultural heritage protection projects due to its unique cultural, historical and artistic value.\n\n\n\n\nYueyang Huagu Opera originated in the Guihai period of Jiaqing in the Qing Dynasty (1803), and has a history of more than 200 years. It is mainly popular in dozens of counties and cities near Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi provinces, and is deeply loved by the general public. During the long-term development process, Yueyang Huagu Opera has widely absorbed the characteristics of Yueyang folk tunes and folk songs, and at the same time absorbed the artistic factors of other operas. It has a unique artistic style. Its singing style is high-pitched, bright, pure and simple, and clear, and it sings with companions and conveys emotions with voices. It is good at expressing passionate and generous, tragic and magnificent singing scenes, and can also express deep, gentle and sad emotions. It has the characteristics of folk music in northern Hunan and the local atmosphere.\n\n\n\n\nStills from Yueyang Flower Drum Opera \"Xu Xianyou Lake\"\n\n\n\n\nStills from Yueyang Flower Drum Opera \"The Top Scholar and the Beggar\"\n\n\n\n\nStills from the play \"Little Girl\"\n\n \n\nYueyang Huagu Opera Music mainly explains the characteristics of singing style, cutscenes, gongs and drums, and instruments and accompaniment. The singing style of Yueyang Huagu Opera is divided into two types: gong tuning and qin tuning. The gong is also known as the gong cam, which is divided into the gong cam and the special gong cam. The gong tune is the basic vocal tune of Yueyang Huagu Opera. Due to the different musical materials, it is divided into the South Road gong tune and the North Road gong tune. The lyrical lyrical lyrical of the South Road and the tragic yrical yrical of the North Road. Yueyang Huagu Opera, men and women are not divided. The male female singer sings a small voice, and the young student uses her own voice to lead a small voice. In terms of singing, Sheng, Dan and Chou still have their own characteristics. In addition to the rhyme and opera, the local language in Yueyang is used as the stage language, and is popular in several counties adjacent to Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi. Yueyang Huagu Opera was born from the ugly \"two small\" drama. Then the role of Xiaosheng was added, which became the \"Three Little\" drama. With the enrichment of the content of the play, it has developed into the four ranks of Sheng, Dan, Jing and Chou on the basis of the \"three smalls\". Jingxing plays few roles, and his performance is slightly the same as that of ordinary small dramas, without obvious characteristics.\n\n\n\n\nYueyang Huagu Opera has rich repertoire resources, including 123 traditional repertoire. The plays such as \"Replenishing the Past\", \"Snow Plum Gives Children\" and \"Three Sons Fighting for Father\" have been performed on the stage for a long time. In the major performances that have always been around, Yueyang Huagu Opera has achieved remarkable results. In 1956, the drama \"Supplement\" was performed in Beijing. Chairman Mao Zedong and Premier Zhou Enlai came to watch it in person, and were warmly received and deeply encouraged by Premier Zhou Enlai. Since then, a large number of plays such as \"Aitoshi Sitting in the Hall\" and \"Dongting Chun\" have participated in performances at all levels and won many awards; the troupe has also performed many special performances for leaders such as Zhu Rongji, Wang Shoudao, Mao Zhiyong, Liu Zheng and many VIPs and foreign guests, which have been highly praised. Yueyang Huagu Opera not only has its unique aesthetic value in art, but also because it is rooted in the folk local area of ​​Yueyang, has a strong local color, carries a large amount of historical, cultural and artistic information, and has become a precious wealth in the treasure house of local opera in my country. In recent years, due to the high attention of the Yueyang County Party Committee and County Government and the attention of enthusiastic people from all walks of life, Yueyang Huagu Opera has embarked on the road of rejuvenation and is striving toward a higher goal.\n\n\n\n\nStills from the traditional flower drum drama \"Qingfeng Pavilion\"\n\n\n\n\nStills from Yueyang Flower Drum Opera \"Guo Ziyi's Birthday\""

    "description": "\n\n龙舞（九龙舞）\n\n\n\n\n项目类别：传统舞蹈\n\n\n\n\n2008年被批准为第二批国家级非物质文化遗产保护项目\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n平江九龙舞历史悠久，据史料记载： “始于汉、兴于唐，演绎至今。”(参阅《平江县文化志》)它发源于平江县伍市镇白杨村的姚姓家族，相传楚国爱国诗人屈原在汨罗江投江后，洞庭湖龙王不让其忠魂返回人间。龙王的九个儿子常在汨江遨游，得知老百姓深深爱戴、怀念屈原，每逢端午节驾起龙舟，打捞屈原忠魂，他们对龙王依仗权势，迫害忠魂不满。于是，他们请来玉皇大帝，接来南海观音，在洞庭湖畔掀起巨澜，迫使龙王将屈原忠魂送还人间。据姚氏健在的老人姚佩凡回顾，白杨姚姓曾有一本祖上留下来的九龙舞《龙谱》，文化大革命期间破“四旧”，将这本世代留传的《龙谱》付之一炬，化为灰烬。《龙谱》的凡例曾这样记述龙舞：“三皇五帝定乾坤，伏羲文王八卦灵，龙光普照兴万业，仁义忠孝治国兴。”\n\n\n\n\n平江县九龙舞形成的历史悠久，对于研究平江的历史、生产、生活、民风、民俗等都有着十分重要的价值。从起源至今，经一代又一代艺人的不断推陈出新，表演套路由简到繁，由粗到精，已形成了其独特的表演艺术形式，阵容庞大（九条龙同场表演，每条龙由10位青壮年舞着，包括司锣、司鼓、司号、旗幡手等，每场演出都得有200人同场献艺，舞龙者传统称为龙兵），阵势复杂（大小表演套路20多个，整个套路表演完毕，需要3个半小时，大套路套小套路，环环相扣，变幻莫测，看了令人目不暇接，眼花燎乱），在中国龙舞中可谓独树一帜。\n\n\n\n\n1988年，九龙舞参加平江县“金龙杯”民间艺术节，一举夺魁。后继续挖掘、整理、排练，推出了《九龙闹洞庭》、《威风中国龙》等一系列大型民族龙舞。1991年，《九龙闹洞庭》在岳阳国际龙舟节表演获得巨大成功，荣获表演金奖，受到了海内外观众的高度赞扬，中央电视台、《人民日报》、《人民画报》、《湖南日报》等10余家新闻媒体争相采访报导。县委书记、县长亲自到街头迎接载誉归来的九龙舞队。这在平江文化发展史上是十分罕见的。\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2000年，受特邀参加“中国金鹰电视艺术节”开幕式表演，得到广大观众的高度赞扬，艺术节总编导给予了充分肯定，他说：你们的表演相当成功，真不愧是“中国民间艺术之乡”的龙队。九龙舞成为平江文化艺术的品牌，名声远扬。自1992年起，九龙舞先后28次参加省、市、县的艺术表演，所到之处都受到了广大观众和专家的高度赞扬,中央电视台将九龙舞拍成专题作为“中华一绝”向世界推介。2000年，国家文化部授予伍市镇“中国民间艺术之乡”称号。2006年，平江白杨九龙舞成功申报为省级非物质文化遗产保护项目，2008年被批准为第二批国家级非物质文化遗产保护项目。\n\n\n\n\n九龙舞表演所需器具主要是：布龙、打击乐、器乐、旗幡等。其中打击乐抛天锣由本地铜匠打造，做工较为粗糙，打造痕迹明显。按锣鼓曲谱边击边抛，善抛者，锣能垂直上升高空数丈，余音绕梁，令人叹为观止，属平江独有的打击器乐。但由于时代发展，一些传统产品不断地被先进的新产品所替代，一些土生土长的铜匠、鼓匠生意市场萎缩，手艺无人传承，九龙舞将面临原生态的平江打击器乐缺少状况，将会大大淡化其地方特色和降低艺术品位。同时，年轻人外出打工的人数逐年增多，龙兵的更新换代频率增高，给九龙舞的传承及保护造成了一定的困难。为使九龙舞能继续得以传承、发展，九龙舞第八代代表性传承人姚大明自2010年开始带领龙舞队员就近在时丰中学传授九龙舞技艺，由最开始的二龙，逐渐到四龙、六龙，学生龙队舞龙技艺在不断提升，龙舞精神也得到传承和发扬。2017年，因龙舞进校园传承成绩突出，被中央电视台教育频道《传承的力量》栏目采访拍摄，并在端午期间向全国播出。\n\n \n\n \n\n\n",

    "description-en": "Dragon Dance (Nine Dragon Dance)\n\n\n\n\nProject Category: Traditional Dance\n\n\n\n\nIt was approved as the second batch of national intangible cultural heritage protection projects in 2008\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPingjiang Jiulong Dance has a long history. According to historical records, \"It started in the Han Dynasty, rose in the Tang Dynasty, and has been interpreted to this day.\" (See \"Pingjiang County Cultural Chronicles\") It originated from the Yao family in Baiyang Village, Wushi Town, Pingjiang County. According to legend, after the patriotic poet Qu Yuan of Chu jumped into the Miluo River, the Dragon King of Dongting Lake did not allow his loyal soul to return to the world. The nine sons of the Dragon King often travel in the Mijiang River. They learned that the people deeply loved and missed Qu Yuan. They drove a dragon boat to salvage Qu Yuan's loyal soul on the Dragon Boat Festival. They were dissatisfied with the Dragon King's reliance on power and persecuted the loyal soul. So, they invited the Jade Emperor and brought the Guanyin of the South China Sea, causing a huge wave on the shore of Dongting Lake, forcing the Dragon King to return Qu Yuan's loyal soul to the world. According to Yao Peifan, an old man who lived in Yao's family, the Yao family once had a copy of the \"Dragon Book\" left by their ancestors. During the Cultural Revolution, the \"Four Olds\" were broken and the \"Dragon Book\" left over from generation to generation were burned to ashes. The regular examples of \"Dragon Book\" once recorded dragon dance like this: \"The Three Emperors and Five Emperors determine the universe, Fuxi and Wen Wang, the Eight Trigrams, the dragon light shines on all things, and benevolence, righteousness, loyalty and filial piety to govern the country.\"\n\n\n\n\nThe Jiulong Dance in Pingjiang County has a long history and is of great value for studying Pingjiang's history, production, life, folk customs, and folk customs. From its origin to the present, it has been continuously innovated by generations of artists, and its performance routines have been formed from simple to traditional, from rough to exquisite, with a unique performance art form. The lineup is huge (nine dragons perform in the same show, each dragon is danced by 10 young and middle-aged people, including Si Luo, Si Drum, Si Hu, Flag and Banner Hand, etc. Each performance must have 200 people perform in the same show. The dragon dancer is traditionally called the Dragon Soldier), and the formation is complex (more than 20 large and large performance routines, and it takes 3 and a half hours to complete the entire routine. The big routine is intertwined and unpredictable, and it is dazzling and dazzling to see it). It is unique in Chinese dragon dance.\n\n\n\n\nIn 1988, Jiulong Dance participated in the Pingjiang County \"Golden Dragon Cup\" Folk Art Festival and won the championship in one fell swoop. Later, we continued to excavate, organize and rehearse, and launched a series of large-scale ethnic dragon dances such as \"Nine Dragons Are Not Troubled in Dongting\" and \"Magnificent Chinese Dragon\". In 1991, \"Nine Dragons Are Not Troubled in Dongting\" achieved great success in the Yueyang International Dragon Boat Festival, winning the performance gold medal, and was highly praised by audiences at home and abroad. More than 10 news media including CCTV, People's Daily, People's Pictorial, Hunan Daily, etc. competed to interview and report. The county party secretary and county magistrate personally went to the streets to welcome the Jiulong Dance Team who returned with honor. This is very rare in the history of Pingjiang culture development.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2000, he was specially invited to participate in the opening ceremony of the \"China Golden Eagle TV Art Festival\", which was highly praised by the audience. The director of the art festival fully affirmed it. He said: Your performance is quite successful and you are truly the dragon team of the \"Hometown of Chinese Folk Art\". Jiulong Dance has become a brand of Pingjiang culture and art, and is well-known. Since 1992, Kowloon Dance has participated in art performances in provinces, cities and counties 28 times, and has been highly praised by the audience and experts wherever they go. CCTV has introduced the Kowloon Dance as a special topic as \"the best of China\". In 2000, the Ministry of Culture awarded Wushi Town the title of \"Hometown of Chinese Folk Art\". In 2006, Pingjiang Poplar Jiulong Dance was successfully applied for as a provincial intangible cultural heritage protection project, and was approved as the second batch of national intangible cultural heritage protection projects in 2008.\n\n\n\n\nThe main tools required for the Kowloon dance performance are: cloth dragons, percussion music, instrumental music, flags, etc. Among them, the percussion gong was made by local copper smiths, with rough workmanship and obvious traces of creation. According to the gong and drum score, you can hit and throw while hitting. Those who are good at throwing can rise vertically for several feet high, and the lingering sound lingers on the beam, which is breathtaking and is a unique blowing instrument music in Pingjiang. However, due to the development of the times, some traditional products are constantly replaced by advanced new products. The business market of some native copper smiths and drummers has shrunk and their craftsmanship is uninherited. Jiulong Dance will face the lack of original Pingjiang blow instrumental music, which will greatly downplay its local characteristics and reduce the artistic taste. At the same time, the number of young people going out to work has increased year by year, and the frequency of renewal of dragon soldiers has increased, which has caused certain difficulties in the inheritance and protection of the Jiulong Dance. In order to enable the Nine Dragon Dance to continue to be inherited and developed, Yao Daming, the eighth-generation representative inheritor of the Nine Dragon Dance, has led the Dragon Dance team members to teach the Nine Dragon Dance skills at Shifeng Middle School in 2010. From the first two dragons to the four dragons and six dragons, the student dragon dance skills are constantly improving, and the dragon dance spirit has also been inherited and carried forward. In 2017, because of his outstanding achievements in inheriting the campus, he was interviewed and filmed by the CCTV Education Channel's \"The Power of Inheritance\" column and broadcast it nationwide during the Dragon Boat Festival.\n\n \n\n "

Due to the differences in various factors such as politics, economic conditions, historical culture, national habits, and language characteristics, different characteristics constitute different characteristics. The lyrics of fishermen often express their feelings when they see the scenery, improvise their feelings, and sing them casually.

    "description-en": "The custom of monks in Jiashan Zen Temple to cultivate and cultivate Jiashan Zen tea is mainly spread in Shimen County and surrounding areas of Hunan Province, affecting the local area of ​​Hunan and the Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Fujian areas, and spreading overseas. At the beginning of the construction of the temple in Jiashan in 870 AD, the founding Zushanhui used Biyanquan in front of the temple to drink the ox-tree tea produced by the temple. He savored it carefully and realized the true meaning of \"tea Zen alone\". He also led his disciples to practice the seeding, making, brewing and drinking of Zen tea, and gradually formed the custom of Jiashan Zen tea. The oxong tea produced in Jiashan is named after its leaves and buds are like ox horns after brewing. It has a good shape, color and taste. It has been a tribute from the Song Dynasty and is also the best of Jiashan Zen tea. The monks personally experienced the entire process of planting, picking, making, brewing and drinking Zen tea, forming a complete set of Zen tea etiquette and customs. Its main contents include eight procedures, including worshiping ancestors, fasting and mining, offering and brewing, washing the heart and enlightenment, and tea consumption and enlightenment. In addition to the normal use of these eight procedures for the tea art of monks and lay Buddhists to practice, the temple is also used for large-scale Buddhist activities and concierges to entertain guests. During traditional festivals such as the Spring Festival, Shangyuan, Qingming Festival, Zhongyuan, and Mid-Autumn Festival, tea parties and temple fairs are used to provide tea to the people and educate them in the customs of tea. Its tea-making etiquette and skills contain the true meaning of \"righteous, clear, harmonious and elegant\", and includes the meanings of integrity, gratitude, clarity, tolerance, sharing, and connection. The custom of Jiashan Zen tea relies on collective inheritance and master-disciple inheritance, and flows to the people through Buddhist activities and lay Buddhists, pilgrims, etc. \"Tea and Zen are the core of Zen tea customs. The monks and lay culture is integrated, the elegant and vulgar interests are combined, and the physical and mental cultivation is the source of Japanese and Korean tea ceremony, and it has important reference value for studying the development of Chinese Buddhist Zen culture and tea culture.

    "description-en": "Tujia funeral dance scene\n\n\n\n\nThe Tujia funeral dance is an ancient funeral dance unique to the Tujia people, also known as \"dance drum\" and \"Sayeerhe\". It is mainly circulated in Hupingshan Town, Luoping Township, Nanbei Town, Taiping Town, Ziliang Township and other places in Shimen County. It is also spread in western Hunan, and in areas such as Changyang and Hefeng, Hubei. \n\n\n\n\nShimen was originally a land of Wuxi. It has been a minority settlement area with the Tujia people as the main body since ancient times. According to Tujia customs, all elderly people with children can go to mourning and worship after their death. Relatives and friends sing and dance around the coffin of the deceased, allowing the deceased to enjoy the happiness of the world for the last time before they were buried in the soil. There are three forms of funeral dance: double, three, and group dance. The movements include \"summary\", \"stomping on the line\", \"snow stirring the wind\", \"phoenix flashing wings\", and \"martial arts and funerals\". Among them, martial arts and funerals are also called \"martial arts and funerals\", which is a more intense style. Among various dance moves, there are many dance postures that imitate natural animals or production labor situations: the animals are \"Cow rubbed the head\", \"Tiger hugged the head\", \"Rhino looking at the moon\", etc., and the characters are imitated such as \"Guanyin sitting in the hall\", \"Wu Song fighting the tiger\", etc., and the movements are either strong, steady or relaxed. The main feature is that the dancer constantly trembles all over his body, the hips swing with a large range, and the upper limbs naturally sway in front of his chest as the hips swing, and the movements are rough and powerful. There are fixed musical instruments for dancing funeral dances, such as \"Yaoyaohuo\", \"Yaoyaoyao\", \"Yaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyaoyao The drummer is a song spoken by the drummer, and there are no other instruments. The rhythm is adjusted by the drummer. Each set of lyrics has no fixed lyrics, and the lyrics are taken from local folk songs and folk songs. The song has a wide tune, a booming range and a bright rhythm. In addition to singing a few lyrics of mourning when mourning the dead, the main content is to tell the origin of mankind, ethnic migration, and legends. It has nothing to do with funeral. There is no requirement for costumes when dancing mourning dances. Performers wear their usual clothes when dancing mourning, and do not need to be replaced. \n\n\n\n\nThe inheritance of the dance dance is mainly based on the inheritance of the master and the disciple. The dance steps and music are the remains of primitive art, and the optimism expressed reflects the Tujia people's view of funerals and life and death that regards the elderly's funerals as \"white joy\". \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Shimen County Cultural Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nLiu Yuanzheng and his master Kang Beihai performed a funeral dance (Photo by Wanli)\n\n\n\n\nLiu Yuanzheng\n\n(June 1947-March 2019) Male, Tujia, from Guanshan Village, Hupingshan Town, Shimen County, Hunan Province, and a representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of the Tujia people dancing funerals. \n\nIn 1965, he began to learn from his master and learned from Kang Beihai. He has fully mastered the core skills, performance skills, dance sets, drum music skills, etc. of the Tujia people's funeral dance, and is familiar with the inheritance and historical development of the project, and collected and organized relevant dance materials.

    "description-en": "Drinking Lecha for birthday celebrations (photo by Chen Zhenkun)\n\n\n\n\nThe custom of lei tea is widely distributed in Changde City, Hunan Province and is popular in Taohuayuan Scenic Area and surrounding townships. \n\n\n\n\nPeach Blossom Land has a long history. Legend has it that in the 25th year of Jianwu in the Eastern Han Dynasty, General Fubo Ma Yuan conquered Wuxi Manchus and passed by Wutou Village (now Taohuayuan). Because he was not accustomed to the water and land, he was infected with miasma, wind and cold, and many soldiers died of epidemics, and Ma Yuan also fell ill. An old woman from the local area presented the secret recipe of \"Sansheng Tang\" (mash raw rice, ginger, and raw tea in a stew, and pour boiled water into the soup). After Ma Yuan ordered the whole army to drink it, the disease was cured. Since then, \"Sansheng Decoction\" can cure all diseases and has been passed down to this day and has become a custom in the local area. There are many varieties of Lecha, and the hobbies are different in different places, and the formula is also different. In summary, there are mainly two categories: \"Qingshui Lecha\" and \"Huo Luecha\". The main raw materials of Qingshui Lecha include tea, ginger, sesame, soybeans, mung beans, salt, etc. In some places, a small amount of rice is placed. Huhu Leicha only adds rice flour to the raw materials, put it in a pot and add water to boil it into a paste. In addition, the main raw materials are ginger, raw rice, and raw tea are called \"Sansheng Tang\", and the ones that add dogwood and mung beans are called \"Wuwei Tang\"; the ones that mainly use rice (fried rice) are called \"Jianmi Lecha\"; and the other is also recognized as Chinese medicine, called \"Qibao Lecha\", etc. When making tea, first place the ingredients in the tea bowl and use a wooden stick to make a pulp, which is called \"Ta Tea Foot\". When making tea, first put an appropriate amount of \"foot\" in the bowl, then melt it with a little cold water, and then rinse it with boiling water. When drinking tea, some homemade side dishes and jars of vegetables are often placed on the table, called \"press table\". Drink lei tea while it is hot, it tastes spicy, fragrant, salty and sweet, better than fine wine. The time for drinking leicha varies from person to person. Whether it is the hot summer or the cold winter, some are used for lunch, some are used for breakfast and Chinese food as drinks, and some are used for late-night snacks during festive festivals. When guests come to their home, they often have to put a table of tea on them. Therefore, Leicha is not only a drink that Taoyuan people often drink, but also a good product for their guests. \n\n\n\n\nThe way of inheriting Lecha customs is mainly family inheritance. Whenever relatives and friends gather together, neighbors and neighbors are connected, the elders are invited to sit down, and everyone is close to each other. Some of them are asking each other about their well-being, while others are chatting about the past and present, family affection, friendship, and neighborly love are reflected everywhere in the lively custom of tea, which is a happy and beautiful scenery in the paradise. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Taoyuan County Cultural Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nWan Zhichu made Lechajiaozi\n\n\n\n\nWan Zhichu\n\n(July 1954—) Male, Han nationality, from Qingshan Village, Taohuayuan Town, Taoyuan County, Hunan Province, and a representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of Leicha customs. \n\nIn 1981, he started to engage in the production and management of Leicha in Taohuayuan Scenic Spots with his parents, becoming a leading figure in the industry with good skills, many varieties of Leicha, rich food, and famous in the industry. He has been engaged in the production and operation of Leicha for more than 30 years and has developed the Leicha varieties including Wuwei Leicha, Sansheng Tang Leicha, Huosu Leicha, Qingshui Leicha, Mudshui Leicha, Jianmi Leicha, Qibao Leicha, etc. The carefully beaten lyche feet can be anti-corrosive for three months.

Marriage friends' homes give away each other wine and fruits, making rice, pasta, food and wine to serve as storage for welcome the new year.\" During the Guangxu period of the Qing Dynasty, there were records of restaurants producing rice noodles. The main raw material of Changde rice noodles is rice, which emphasizes that early rice cannot be produced. The production techniques of Changde rice noodles must be completed through the processes of selecting rice, soaking, refining, filtering water, steaming, pounding, rubbing, squeezing, cooking, and cold soaking. Early indica rice is made into white, round, slender and elastic vermicelli after more than ten hours of water soaking, beating, heating, and shaping. The reason why Changde rice noodles are very popular is that one of them is like a dragon's beard, symbolizing auspiciousness. During the holidays, eating rice noodles is to show that in the years to come, the family will be as reunited as rice noodles, and life will be as fine as rice noodles. Second, rice noodles are convenient to eat and economical. After buying the rice noodles, just burn them with boiling water and add seasonings to eat. The processing is simple and clean.

They developed with the introduction of the \"Yoga Sect\" into the Taoyuan area. Yoga is the \"Yokao-only School\" in Buddhism, and Maitreya is respected as its ancestor. Yoga means \"correspondence\". The so-called \"Justice can reach the other shore, which is the most supreme convenience of great Bodhi\", so it is called \"Yoga\" (\"The Holy Teaching of Examination and Exaltation into Yoga\"). \"Yankou\" is also called \"Fengran\", which is the name of hungry ghosts in Buddhism. According to legend, hungry ghosts have thin bones and small throats. When they see them at night, they will blew flames on their mouths, so they are called \"Yankou\". Yoga Yankou is a Buddhist activity. In order to prevent themselves from becoming hungry ghosts and relieve the suffering of hungry ghosts, Buddhists usually hold rituals at dusk to ask for help from the Buddha. Taoyuan Yoga has many flame mouth gestures, accompanied by mantras, including 94 types of proverb gestures and 34 types of oral recitation gestures. When conducting Buddhist activities, different schools wear different costumes. Generally, the host wears a five- Buddha crown on his head, a red robe with a round-necked green robe, a whisk with his right finger, placed it on his left shoulder, and sat cross-legged in front of the incense table. The band sat on both sides to accompany the instruments. The accompaniment instruments include garland, small bell, wooden fish, drum, sheng, flute, flute, tube, huqin, etc., and the tune is generally low. The Taoyuan Yoga Flame Mouth gesture is performed in the content when performing Buddhist activities. It can be divided into 10 groups, including Zhunti, Five Directions Gods, Thousand Buddhas, Vajra, Guanyin, Three Treasures, Lotus, Demons, and Five Mountains, and each has its own meaning. Each set of gestures originated from life, and has been highly summarized, refined, and has strong imitation. The inheritance method is mainly based on the inheritance of master and apprentice. \n\n\n\n\nTaoyuan yoga flame mouth gestures penetrate each other with the long-standing Chu customs and Taoist customs, and coexist with the occurrence and development of folk activities. They have a certain sense of mystery and sacredness. They have certain reference value for studying the origin, evolution, and development of Taoyuan religious dance. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Taoyuan County Cultural Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nLiu Qingyuan performed yoga flame mouth gestures during Buddhist activities (photo by Chen Zhenkun)\n\n\n\n\nLiu Qingyuan\n\n(March 1940 —) Male, Han nationality, from Zhuyuan Village, Huangjiapu, Qihe Town, Taoyuan County, Hunan Province, representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of Taoyuan Yoga Flame Gesture. \n\nSince he was a child, he learned from Zhang Chenglin, the master of the Xuanmiao Dharma School of Lingyan Temple.

It is named after the tool of labor is stone romance and is mainly circulated in Anxiang County, Hunan Province. \n\n\n\n\nAnxiang Ju Song has a long history and is mainly sung in local dialects. Due to different dialects, two major schools have been formed in Anxiang: \"Nanxiang Ju Song\" (represented by Yukou Town below) and \"Xixiang Ju Song\" (represented by Anfu Township and Anning Township). The songs of Anxiang are mainly sung when building dikes and ramming earth. The sacred one is divided into flying sacred one and lifting one. Feiju is a piece of bluestone about two feet square, twenty centimeters thick, and fifty kilograms. There are holes in the four corners, and eight ropes are tied. Each of the eight laborers pull one, standing in all directions of Feiju, and tamping down along the new soil that was laid out. Feiji is mainly used to flatten the dike slope surface; lifting the dike is a stone pillar about one meter high, one foot square, and about eighty kilograms, and four sturdy wooden sticks are tied to eight wooden handles at the top of the stone pillar. The eight burly men each held their own hands, and tried their best to raise the song according to the melody and rhythm of the song, and then suddenly let go and smash the soil to loosen the soil. Lifting is mainly used to compact the body of the embankment. Due to different labor intensity, the music styles of the singing are also different. Compared with the take-off, the lifting of the horn and tune are much heavier, and the horn and tune are also deeper. The singing style of Anxiang Jue is led by one person and everyone is helped. Under the command of the trumpet, everyone beat up and down, sometimes left and right, their movements were neat and their enthusiasm for labor was high. This will play a role in unifying the rhythm, eliminating fatigue and boosting morale. The musical tunes of Anxiang Ju Song are high-pitched and bright, with a magnificent momentum. At the same time, the rhythm is strong and the strength changes clearly. The rhythm is two or four beats, and the strength is one strong and the other weak, repeated. Its melody is beautiful and lively and leaps. The common modes of Anxiang Zhu Song are five tone symbols and business modes. The most basic feature of its tone is one beat and one sound, and there are many homophones. The four, fifth, and sixth degree jumps often occur during the melody, and the range is not wide. The sentence structure is mostly seven-character sentences with four or three structures, with short structures and flexible and changeable. At the same time, the lines and lines play a very important role in the song. The lyrics are concise and concise, with rich lyrics, and the songs are divided into two types: editing and fixed singing. \n\n\n\n\nThere is no fixed master in the inheritance of Anxiang Jue Song. Generations focus on those who are eloquent and naturally have a good voice. It is a spontaneous oral inheritance of the people. The lead singer of the song often sings some stories and folk legends that reflect labor life, folk customs, ethics, astronomy, geography, and the history of characters. These songs echo the emotions and mental states of the working people on site, and truly reflect the thoughts, emotions, values ​​and cultural life of the working people. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Anxiang County Cultural Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nXia Anbang's songs inherited in school\n\n\n\n\nXia'anbang\n\n(December 1948—) Male, Han nationality, from Shenliu Town, Anxiang County, Hunan Province, and a representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of Anxiang Jingge.\n\nIn the 1970s, due to work, he directly contacted folk artists Sun Tiansheng and Sun Zhengcai, who were good at singing songs, and began to learn to sing Anxiang Zhu songs and collect and organize the songs.

Representative songs include \"Is there a thing to borrow,\" \"Second Sister to drive the cow\", etc. \n\n\n\n\nThe inheritance method of Tujia folk songs in Shimen is mainly based on the collective inheritance of the village, family inheritance and master-apprentice inheritance.

The legend of Shanjuan is mainly circulated in Changde City, Hunan Province, and is also spread in adjacent Zhangjiajie City, Yueyang City, and Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture. The legend of Shanjuan has been circulating for more than two thousand years since the Warring States Period. The earliest book \"Shen Zi Yiwen\" during the Warring States Period records: \"Yao gave Xu You and Shun gave Shan Juan, both of whom resigned as emperors, and retreated as ordinary men.\" It tells the story of Shan Juan rather than being emperors. Local chronicles of various eras later described Shanjuan's behavior of \"letting the emperor\", \"enlightening the people's wisdom\" and \"producing the good deeds\" in Deshan and Shanjuan. The legend of Shanjuan is themed on \"good\" and \"virtue\", which shows Mr. Shanjuan's noble virtues such as kindness, humility, indifference to fame and fortune, and education of the people from different aspects. The story of Shanjuan’s good virtues has been praised by emperors of all dynasties and has been widely used for thousands of years and has a lot of historical materials. There are records in \"Zhuangzi\", \"Lüshi Chunqiu\", \"Huainanzi\", \"Liezi\", \"Yuanhe County Chronicles\", and \"Huguang General Chronicles\". The records are orderly and highly verified in history. Although historical sites such as Shanjuan Altar built by Fan Zigai, who served as the governor of Langzhou in the Sui Dynasty, have disappeared after thousands of years of storms, it is difficult to find related relics such as Shanjuan Village, Shanjuan Tomb, Shanjuan Fishing Platform, Shanjuan Well. However, there are hundreds of literary works such as folk legends, poems, folk songs, and prose titled by Mr. Shanjuan, such as \"The Emperor of Shanjuan\", \"The Emperor of Shanjuan, Chiyou and Wuling\", \"The Mountain of Changde De Mountain is Virtuous\", \"The Praise of Shanjuan\", \"The Mountain of Shanjuan\", etc. Several poets, including Qu Yuan, Li Bai, Liu Yuxi, Wang Anshi, etc., all praised Mr. Shanjuan's poetry works. It has an influence on all kinds of art forms that are circulated in Changde today. For example, \"Shan Juan and Bailongtan\", \"Shan Juan Life Bulletin\", \"Shan Juan Ancient Altar\", etc., all have strong reality and certain mythological colors, and have a broad mass base. The legend of Shanjuan has been accumulated over thousands of years and has many inherited contents and forms. At present, school teaching is the main method of inheritance and promotion. The Shande culture in the legend of Shanjuan is an important source of Hunan culture and Jingchu culture, and has strong historical and literary and artistic research value.

    "description-en": "Changde silk string\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChangde silk strings are an important branch of Hunan silk strings. Because they are the most developed and have the greatest influence among Hunan silk strings, they have already become independent styles.\n\n \n\nHunan silk strings are spread throughout Hunan and are named after the accompaniment of silk string instruments such as Yangqin, Pipa, Yueqin, Sanxian, Erhu, and Jinghu. It was developed from the integration of the sequel to Hunan in Jiangsu and Zhejiang and the local folk songs from Hunan, around the early Qing Dynasty. This type of music is performed in Hunan music. In the circulation of various parts of Hunan, it has formed distinctive branches such as the \"Changde Silk String\" centered on Changde, the \"Changsha Silk String\" centered on Changsha, the \"Liuyang Silk String\" centered on Liuyang, the \"Pingjiang Silk String\" centered on Pingjiang, the \"Hengyang Silk String\" centered on Hengyang and the \"Shaoyang Silk String\" centered on Shaoyang, and the \"Changde Silk String\" centered on Shaoyang. Among them, the \"Changde Silk String\" is the most prosperous.\n\n \n\n    \n\n\n\n\nThe traditional performance form of Hunan silk strings, including Changde silk strings, is that many people sit around in a circle, holding yangqin, drum board, Jinghu, erhu, sanxian and pipa, and rap, and have certain rules for the seating and the position of the instrument. The so-called \"Yangqin vs. Drum board, Jinghu vs. Erhu, and sanxian vs. Pipa\", the performance is mainly sung, and there are some preachings. There are four types of \"confession\" (third person), \"speaking\" (first person), dialogue and inserting white. Most of them are prose styles, with occasional rhymes. Most of the programs are legendary stories such as \"The West Chamber\", \"The Second Plum\", and \"Qin Xianglian\". Later, Hunan Silk Strings walked onto the platform and became one to two people singing on the beats of simple boards. Many people also held yangqin, drum boards, Jinghu, erhu, Sanxian and Pipa to specialize in accompaniment. The program also became shorter, and representatives include \"Autumn River\", \"Chasing Han Xin\", \"Xu Ce Runs the City\", \"Four Seasons Lovesickness\", etc.\n\n    \n\nHunan Silk Strings have rich and colorful singing music. According to the singing style used, they can be divided into two categories: \"brand silk strings\" and \"board silk strings\". Among them, the \"brand silk string\" is mainly composed of singing music cards, and the tunes are very rich, including [Putianle], [Qingjiang Yin], [A Flower], [Little Peach Red], etc., which originated from the music of the north and south, [Silver Twins], [Nine Chain], [Reversed Paddle], [Four Major Scenery], etc., which originated from the music and folk songs in other places, and [Lotus Fall], [Fengyang Tune], [Doubagao High Speech], [Anqing Tune], etc. \"Banzi Silk Strings\" are divided into two vocal styles: \"Old Road\" and \"Chuan Road\". \"Old Road\" is a popular local singing style in Changde area. It has a deep and profound style. Representative programs include \"Snow Plum Dang Xiao\" and \"Qingfeng Pavilion\". According to legend, \"Chuan Road\" was reported to be from Sichuan artist Wan Bincheng in the early days of the Republic of China. The style is enthusiastic and cheerful, and the singing is playful and funny. Representative programs include \"Kanghong\". The basic singing styles of \"board silk strings\" include three types: [first-class], [second-class], and [third-class].\n\n    \n\nChangde Sixian has more than 100 traditional repertoire, most of which are based on historical stories and folk legends, among which are the most famous: \"Baoyu Crying the Spirit\", \"Lu Zhishen Drunk and Killing the Mountain Gate\", \"Shuangshu Going Down the Mountain\", \"Wang Po Swearing the Chicken\", and \"Zhaojun Going Out of the Frontier\". After the founding of the People's Republic of China, a number of new songs reflecting real life, such as \"New Things\", \"Praise the Practitioner\", and \"Snow and Snow Visiting Relatives\".\n\n\n\n\nChangde silk strings have distinct local characteristics and local flavor, and have high artistic value. However, due to the lack of professional performance groups since the 1980s and the passing of older generation of silk string artists, they are currently facing the danger of being lost and need urgent rescue and protection."

Che Yin (about 333-401 AD) from the Ministry of Personnel of the Eastern Jin Dynasty was from Jin City, Hunan Province. He was smart and studious since childhood. Because his family was poor, he often had no oil to light lamps. He caught fireflies in summer and used them to illuminate them to read at night. His knowledge increased day by day and eventually became a well-known scholar. After becoming an adult, Che Yin was always diligent and self-motivated, and was honest in his official position. He was valued by the court. He served as an erudite position in the Imperial College, a general of the Guardian, and a minister of the Ministry of Personnel in his life, achieving great achievements. The story of Che Yin's reading of fireflies comes from real historical figures. To this day, there are historical relics such as the Fireflies and the Fireflies Academy in Che Yin Village, Xinzhou Town, Tianjin. The story first appeared in \"Book of Jin: Biography of Che Yin\" by Che Yin, the story of reading fireflies has been enthusiastically praised by literati of all dynasties. From the Southern and Northern Dynasties to the Republic of China, many documents have been recorded and circulated among the people in the form of oral transmission. It is a historical allusion that people in the past dynasties like to hear. The sentence \"Like a Firefly\" has been included in the \"Three Character Classic\" that children of all dynasties must read, and \"Like a Firefly reflects the snow\" is included in the modern idiom dictionary as an idiom. Since the story of the firefly reading has been passed down, its spirit has not only educated the people in the Jinli area of ​​Yuanfadi, but also inspired the children of Hunan and Xiang, and inspired generations of descendants of Yan and Huang. Students from all dynasties have inherited and promoted Che Yin's spirit of hard study, courage to innovate, patriotism and protection of the country, and have gradually grown into pillars of the country. The story that Che Yin reads by the firefly is a vivid interpretation of the Chinese nation's spirit of self-improvement, and plays a positive role in promoting Chinese traditional virtues and promoting the construction of spiritual civilization in today's society.

It is a legacy of ancient nature worship. As time changes, it has developed into a way to celebrate festive festivals and wish you a better life. The water-splashing dragon lantern is made of fresh rice dumpling leaves as dragon beards, and kudzu vines, yellow jingzi, and pine branches are used as dragon bodies. It is divided into 9 sections, 11 sections, 13 sections, 15 sections and other lengths. The whole body is made of willow branches as dragon skin, and the \"Dragon Treasure\" is also made of willow branches. Wubaoren’s movements draw on some moves in boxing techniques such as “Four Door Fist” and “Eight Tiger Fist”, such as “Su Qin’s sword on his back”, “Tiger jumping into the stream”, and “Beautiful woman combing her hair”. There are deacons such as fish, shrimp, clams and clams on the second side of the water dragon. There are 9 to 15 people who dance the water dragon, all of whom are good at water. They wore wicker circles on their heads, wrapped ears tightly, shirtless shorts, accompanied by sonorous music of gongs, drums and suona. One person held the \"Dragon Treasure\" in front. When the dragon danced happily, there were more than 50 kinds of movements and gameplay in total, \"Two Dragons Grab Treasure\", \"Snake Sheds the Skin\", \"Oulong Treasure\", \"Snake Treasure\", and \"Dragon Playing in the Water\". At the same time, the people watching used washbasins, water scoops, antimony buckets and other containers to pour water around the dragon, splashing water while dancing. The more water the dragon danced, the happier it would be, indicating that the weather was good and the harvest was good. \n\n\n\n\nThe way to inherit the custom of water-splashing dragon is the natural inheritance of the group. Most dragon lantern dancers participate in activities in their spare time because of their hobbies, with the purpose of entertaining themselves. Famous water-splashing dragon masters teach arts most in winter. When they are free, learners gather to come to ask for advice is the main way of inheritance.

Not wanting to be newly married, Fan Xilang was still captured by the government and escorted to the border to build the Great Wall. Due to overwork, Fan Xilang died soon and was buried under the Great Wall. Meng Jiang is waiting for her husband to return every day at home.

    "description-en": "Sangzhi Bai tribe traveling to the meeting (Photo by Li Weiyue)\n\n\n\n\nThe Sangzhi Bai people's traveling to the gods is a unique folk cultural activity of the Bai people in Hunan Province, and it is spread in the Bai people's settlement towns in Sangzhi County, Hunan Province. \n\n\n\n\nIn 1261 AD, Kublai Khan disbanded the \"Cunbai Army\" recruited by Wuliang Hetai. Gu Junwan and others who served in the army went through the Yangtze River, went to Dongting, Manjinli, and Bu Ciyang to settle down in Maidiping and Mahekou areas. This is the origin of the Bai people in Hunan. In order to commemorate ancestors and educate their descendants to keep their ancestors in mind, the descendants of Sangzhi Bai people created a wandering activity. At first, the Youshen in the late Song and early Yuan dynasties had simple procedures and thin content, and there were few people participating. When he was Youshen, he only carried the main statue and went on a patrol in various villages. By the end of the Yuan Dynasty and the beginning of the Ming Dynasty, due to the large increase in the local Bai population and the active local culture, in order to enhance national cohesion and improve national prestige, the Bai people's travel activities gradually enriched the content, improved the procedures, and established a distinctive folk activity system. The Bai people's travelers are widely held in Bai people's townships during the Spring Festival every year. Divided into the big and small. The great travel god can travel for ten days and half a month, and the small travel god can travel for one day. You Shen is divided into three processes: \"Invite God\", \"Enter God\" and \"Survey God\". When the gods are invited, the old sect of the Sanyuan Cult sings \"The Bai people's ancestor worship poems\"; when the gods are entertained, the Huishou (clan leader) and the old sect of the Sanyuan Cult sing \"The Bai people's tone\", and then the statue of the god is carried out from the ancestral temple; when the gods are met, the masses can voluntarily participate in singing and dancing performances, accompanying percussion instruments, performing drums, playing suona and trombone, and shouting folk songs. Both men and women and elderly people can join the team, and shoulder poles, rice baskets, tongs, wooden sticks, wooden barrels, etc. can all be used as props. \n\n\n\n\nYoushen has important historical research value for studying the roots, time, characters, historical events, and ethnic integration of the Sangzhi Bai people. By wandering around, the Bai people achieved harmonious unity between man and God, man and nature, which improved the cohesion of the nation and reflected the Bai people's open, united and open-minded national character. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Sangzhi County Intangible Cultural Heritage Protection Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nZhong Yangsheng (left) is with Zhong Huilong and Zhong Gaowan, the old scholar of Sanyuan Sect\n\n\n\n\nZhong Yangsheng\n\n(January 1932 - December 2012) Male, Bai nationality, from Bai nationality Township, Mahekou, Sangzhi County, Hunan Province, and a representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of the Sangzhi Bai nationality. \n\nHe loved his own culture since he was a child. He began to learn art under Zhong Chaorui, Zhong Chaoen and Zhong Liangxu at the age of 6. He obtained the true teachings of the Bai people's travel activities and was able to sing the words \"Invite Gods\", \"Wandering Gods\", and \"Still the Gods\". Since the establishment of the Bai ethnic township in 1984, he has insisted on organizing large-scale travel activities every year and has become a well-known master of travel activities in Bai ethnic travel activities. We also actively explore, inherit and spread traditional culture, integrate elements of the times into the travel activities, and enrich the content of the travel activities. In recent decades, he has been the leader of the Bai people's god tour activities. He first went to the ancestral hall to invite the main master, and he sang ancestral worship lyrics, and then the team performed other series of activities. He has a high prestige in the local area. In recent years, he has trained new people and brought out his disciples such as Zhong Biwu and Zhong Gaoren, and contributed to the inheritance and development of the Bai people's god tour activities."

Due to its special geographical structure, there is a tornado, hail, and flood disaster zone. The legend of Zhuangbalong is circulated here and has its profound historical and regional roots. The legend of Zunbalong originated in Taiping Town, Shimen County. \"Zhuba\" means \"break\" and \"half\" in the Shimen dialect, and \"Zhubalong\" means \"the dragon with a broken tail\". It is said that a long time ago, there were two mothers and sons who depended on each other. One day, my son picked up a dragon egg and accidentally entered his mouth, turning into a dragon. My mother rushed over and thought that her son had been eaten by a dragon. She beat her shoulder pole and broke her tail and became a stake. The half-man and half-god stake Balong hits the mountain and penetrates the cave, forming a cave through the mountains and rivers. In order to pursue his son, the mother died on the way and left behind place names such as Shiziping, Yinniangxi, Huilong Temple, etc. Wherever Zunbalong swims, it will be storms, heavy water, hail, and flooding. His uncle Xu Zhenjun (some say Guanyin Bodhisattva) cast a spell to lock him into the Kuihua Well in Jiangxi. He asked to return to his hometown to worship his mother every Qingming Festival. His uncle was moved by his filial piety and agreed to his request. Now, around the Qingming Festival, there are always a few days of storm-torn disasters in Shimen County. People say that this is Zhuang Balong who is visiting his mother's grave. The plot of the legend of Zunbalong is unique and the story is tortuous and complete. Among the people in various places, after being passed down from generation to generation, many different versions of the plot, content, character images, etc. have been formed. Such as \"Zhuobalong\" (many articles) in Shimen County, \"Zhuobalong and Baijing Dragon\" in Li County, \"Zhuobalong Sacrifice to the Mother\" in Linli County, \"Bailong Exploration to the Mother\" in Anxiang County, \"Black Dragon\" in Huarong County, etc. In addition to folk oral legends, the legend of Baobalong is also recorded in the \"Shimen County Chronicle\" of Tongzhi of the Qing Dynasty. \n\n\n\n\nThe legend of Baobalong reflects people's beautiful imagination when human power cannot overcome natural disasters, and expresses people's wishes for peace, happiness, tranquility and a happy family. Legend also promotes the filial piety of the mother and the son, which reflects the traditional virtues of the Chinese nation.\n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Shimen County Cultural Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nJia Guohui tells the legend of the stakeholder to the children\n\n\n\n\nJia Guohui\n\n(March 1934 -) Male, Han nationality, from Baiyunqiao Township, Shimen County, Hunan Province, member of the China Folk Artists Association, member of the Chinese Folk Customs Society, and representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of the Legend of Baobalong.\n\nHe heard from childhood that his fathers, especially in the famous folk stories in Shimen and Cili counties, tell the legend of the fourth aunt of Jia Si of the talented man, and became very interested. Later, he remembered it in his heart and was able to tell the series of legends of Baobalong skillfully and vividly. He not only orally inherited this far-reaching folk legend, but also paid attention to its collection, sorting, publishing and other work. He has edited the editor-in-chief of \"Chinese Folk Story Collection·Hunan Volume·Shimen County Materials\" and was promoted nationwide as a model, including 3 \"Legend of Baobalong\". In 2009, he wrote a script called \"Puanbalong\" to promote the Changde comic book album. In recent years, he has actively participated in the activities of intangible cultural heritage entering campuses and classrooms, and has told the legend of Baobalong to primary and secondary school students in the classrooms of many schools."

Tujia brocade, also known as \"counting yarn flowers\", is a traditional weaving process that uses an ancient pure wood waist-type inclined loom, mainly using the \"warp-through and weft-breaking\" flower digging technology, and uses the \"anti-weaving method\" to pick and weave into patterns. According to the technique, it can be divided into two categories: \"opposite\" plain-color series and \"upper-down\" twill color series. Tujia brocade is known for its colorfulness and romance. The pigment is mainly made of natural dyes such as wild safflower, blackberry, turmeric, blue indigo, etc. The silk thread is rinsed and colored, and then used vinegar or alum to fix the color to enhance its luster. The Tujia brocade is made of dark indigo and black as the background, and is matched with red, white, yellow, green, orchid and purple as the weft lines. It is bright but not vulgar and colorful. Among them, the pattern composition is mostly based on geometric patterns with diamonds, horizontal rectangles, and oblique crosses, and abstract techniques are used to express their charm of both spirit and form. The patterns are mainly based on plants, animals, astronomical phenomena, geography, text, etc. There are more than 220 traditional Tujia brocade patterns currently circulating. It is mainly used for quilts, quilts, and cover skirts for children. It is also used for girls to dowry, love, and even for folk activities to waving their hands and sacrificial wall hangings. The Tujia brocade weaving skills are mainly taught by family inheritance through oral transmission. There are linear inheritance within the family, and there are network inheritance within the family in which family relatives learn from each other, forming a phenomenon in which a family, a village is the same inheritance system, or multiple inheritance lines coexist.

In the traditional Tujia embroidery method, the flowers to be embroidered are usually cut into patterns with paper, pasted on the embroidery base cloth, and then embroidered with silk thread according to the pattern. Tujia embroidery is widely used in clothing, headbands, handkerchiefs, shoes and hats, scarves, purses, door curtains, pillow covers, quilts, etc. The patterns are mostly made of natural scenery such as flowers, grass, insects, fish, birds, beasts, bamboos, trees, etc., or traditional festive patterns such as \"dragons and phoenixes present good fortune\", \"carp jumps over the dragon gate\", \"mandarin ducks playing in the water\", \"magpies making fun of plums\", \"crowns and pine waves\". The pattern is exaggerated and deformed, rich in decorative and practicality. In terms of color matching, dark fabrics such as blue, blue, and bright red are generally preferred to use dark fabrics as base cloth, and the embroidery threads for the pattern are mostly light in color; or on the contrary, the bottom cloth flowers are light in color, while the embroidery threads are more intensely dark in color. The embroidery is simple and realistic, with bright and vivid colors and strong contrast, giving people a sense of joy and auspiciousness. The Tujia embroidery in Zhangjiajie also summarizes the traditional acupuncture method \"Nine Needles and Thirteen Methods\", and uses Zhangjiajie's strange mountains and rivers, flowers, birds and beasts, folk customs, literati calligraphy and paintings, etc. as materials. It has innovatively produced series of embroidery and decoration products such as figures, animals, flowers, calligraphy and paintings, and scenery, which have been favored by the market. \n\n\n\n\nTujia embroidery is a reflection of Tujia history and culture, a vivid reflection of humanities and art, and a crystallization of the hard work and wisdom of Tujia women. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Zhangjiajie City Yongding District Cultural Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZhang Xiuyun\n\n(October 1966—) Female, Miao nationality, from Damutang Village, Shataping Township, Sangzhi County, Hunan Province, and a representative inheritor of provincial intangible cultural heritage embroidery by Tujia people. \n\nShe was influenced by her father Zhang Chaoliu and her mother Li Jinxiang since she was young, and she learned embroidery, laying the foundation for her later career in Tujia embroidery.

During the Battle of Hongxia, the \"barbarians\" in Hongxia danced with torches. When making high lanterns, the artist used bamboo strips and paper to make 12 or 24 lanterns, added a long-handled lamp holder under the lantern, lit two candles inside, tied an idol on the top, and cut them into opera stories such as \"Eight Immortals\", \"Geng's Sends a Son\", \"Wagangzhai\", \"Liangshan Heroes\", etc. The lamp represents light and happiness, and the twelve lamps represent twelve months, and every month is safe and sound. The high lanterns are often performed in conjunction with the dragon lantern dance. During the performance, 12 or 24 people were wearing lace-pinned double-breasted shirts, lace-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin-pin Each performer holds a lantern and forms various formations while dancing. Its movements are neat, rhythmic, simple props, and are not restricted by the venue. There are two types of performances: folk lanterns and war lanterns. The former performs the migration, reproduction, labor and life of ancient ancestors; the latter performs the battle to break the formation, which has the meaning of military tactics such as \"attack\", \"retreat\", \"setting up the formation\", and \"breaking the formation\". The formation of the high lanterns changes endlessly, and the transformation of the formation is mainly led by the flag umbrella. Under the noisy sound of gongs, cymbals, suona, and drum music, under the guidance of the umbrella, the lamp team danced wildly with the sound of \"Ahehe\", and formed dozens of formations such as \"Tai Chi Diagram\", \"Single Eight Characters\", \"Double Eight Characters\", \"Continuous Eight Characters\", \"Six Ear Sections\", and \"Four Ear Sections\". Looking at the dark night, the flowing lights are like the galaxy dancing, making people dizzy and relaxed. \n\n\n\n\nThe high lanterns in Zhangjiajie still retain the ancient, primitive, rough, bold and tragic characteristics. The high lanterns were only performed every year during the Spring Festival. Because they were deeply loved by local people, the high lanterns later evolved into the grain and animal lanterns used for festive harvests. People also used \"high lanterns\" of different colors and shapes for \"red\" or \"white\" romances to express emotions and set off the atmosphere. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Zhangjiajie City Yongding District Cultural Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\nQin Tailin (middle) teaches residents to learn about high lanterns in the community\n\n\n\n\nQin Tailin\n\n(June 1929-January 2013) Male, Tujia, from Daoxiang Village, Xiejiaya Township, Yongding District, Zhangjiajie City, Hunan Province, and a representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of Zhangjiajie Gaohualanterns.\n\nUnder the influence of his elders, he liked to play with high lanterns since he was a child.

From the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China, its development entered a prosperous period. \"Youyang Zazu\" records: \"The strong people with the fields are the chiefs of Wuxi, and ten sons, all of whom are extremely brave.\" \"Yongding Township Tuzhi\" records: \"Dayong has Baofushan Temple. During the Daoguang period, there were Taoists who were good at fissures and brave, and could compete with dozens of people.\" Zhangjiajie Guigu Divine Kung Fu is a general term for the performance of traditional Tujia boxing, martial arts and equipment, and martial arts. It aims to \"cultivate internally in spirit, practice both form and spirit, and be united by nature and man\". It has strong regional characteristics and strong national characteristics. The use of Tujia boxing and martial arts equipment originated from the \"Eight Kings\" martial arts of Tujia's ancestors. It was circulated with many boxing and martial arts routines with the characters \"Eight Parts of God-killing\", \"Eight Parts of Chain Boxing\", \"Eight Parts of the Chain Boxing\", \"Eight Parts of the Chain\", \"Eight Battle Hands\", \"Eight Arcs\", \"Eight and Half Waves\", and became the prototype of the later Tujia boxing \"training its shape outside\". Therefore, when Tujia boxers teach boxing in Antang, they first burn incense and invite the master, and they have a mantra that \"a table with four or four sides, burn a furnace of incense in the middle; the eight kings sit in the center, and the master will send me today; I will come to my position today, and I will ask my ancestors to protect my disciples\" to spread the word. The Zhangjiajie Guigu Divine Art has gradually developed in the course of history, and is now mainly used for strengthening the body and martial arts performances. Its main programs include lying on the belly, lying on the steel fork, stinging the knife bed, shaving bricks on the head, storing the ears on the double wind, dividing the five horses, rolling the body of the car, and red evil palms. The most thrilling and amazing. \n\n\n\n\nThe magical skills of the Ghost Valley in Zhangjiajie are passed down through oral teachings and masters. It interprets the complementary principle of the physical connection between nature and man and the inner artistic conception, and is still passed down from generation to generation on this mysterious land in western Hunan. It is a compulsory exercise for the people of Zhangjiajie to strengthen their bodies, and it is an integration of traditional martial arts of various local ethnic groups, with distinct local characteristics. It is also a spiritual manifestation of the bravery and martial arts of Zhangjiajie people and not fearing power. \n\n\n\n\nProject protection unit: Zhangjiajie City Yongding District Cultural Center\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInheritor:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLi Jun\n\n(January 1968—) Male, Tujia, from Guanliping Street, Yongding District, Zhangjiajie City, Hunan Province, first-class national martial arts referee, Chinese martial arts sixth section, and representative inheritor of the provincial intangible cultural heritage of the Guigu Divine Kung Fu in Zhangjiajie.\n\nHe practiced martial arts with his father at the age of 3, and successively learned from masters such as Long Chuanzhou, Zhou Lanfang, and Yan Xizheng.

The author covers and condenses the people and things in the southern villages that he has been familiar with for more than 20 years into the book, embodying political trends and customs and folk customs, and uses the fate of the characters to perform changes in township life, striving to write down the life colors and life styles of the southern villages. \"Furong Town\" is full of national characteristics in its description techniques, namely, \"the extreme distractions of human feelings and worldly conditions, and is ready to write about the joys and sorrows and separations.\" Structurally absorbs the advantages of Chinese classical novels without being restricted by them, making the works present an artistic form that is mainly earth-based and combines earth-based foreign countries.

Jiang Zuizhang, director of the Propaganda Department of the Corps, manipulated the rebels to kidnap Peng Qi and took various measures to kill him. Chen Jingquan, a political commissar of the Corps, presided over the criticism and struggle meeting against Peng Qi, but secretly gave Peng Qi life and spiritual protection to him in trouble. Peng Qi was dismissed and sent back to the Corps and was persecuted by Jiang Zuizhang. Faced with all kinds of false charges and outrageous destruction, Peng Qi firmly believed in the Party and the people, and did not fear power, and fought with Jiang Zuizhang and his gang. After Premier Zhou Enlai learned the news, he sent a plane to pick Peng Qi up to Beijing. \"The Song of the General\" revolves around the experience of the commander of a certain Air Force corps being persecuted during the \"Cultural Revolution\". Through the description of the different destinies of the three generals, it accused Lin Biao and the \"Gang of Four\", which truly reflects the extremely complex and sharp contradictions and struggles in real life, completely denies the \"Cultural Revolution\" movement, and expresses the people's wishes.

    "description-en": "The first meaning of \"Liu Hai Cuts the Woodcutter\" is a kind of flower drum opera in Hunan. Because it sounds very nice and the literary and artistic life of people is very limited in the planning economy era, it was once very popular in various performance teams in urban and rural areas of Hunan. The sketch performances of Hunan singers Li Guyi and Jiang Kun made it famous all over the country on the 1984 Spring Festival Gala. The ancient drama \"Liu Hai Cuts the Woodcutter\" is only part of it, that is, its wonderful duet part.

From the perspective of natural evolution, Orange Island is a typical first-level terrace formation formed in the Quaternary Holocene. The landform belongs to a high river floodplain, which is mainly composed of the following three factors: First, the bedrock in the middle of the river is raised, and the main stream of the Xiang River flows here. The silt carried by the diversion flows back and silt on the bedrock protruding in the middle of the river to form a heart beach; Second, the Yangtze River Changsha section of the Xiang River becomes wider, the river flow rate decreases, and the silt is easy to silt; Third, the water roof of the downstream Liuyang River, Laodao River and Dongting Lake is supported by the water roof, and the mud and sand are easy to silt. It lasts forever and over time, the \"heart beach\" rises up and reveals the water surface through the new tectonic movement to form a river island. There are thousands of flower, grass and vines growing on Orange Island, including 143 of which are precious. There are rare animals such as cranes, herons, gulls, foxes, badgers. In 2012, the Yuelu Mountain-Orange Island Tourism Zone in Changsha was rated as a national AAAAAA scenic spot, and Orange Island is an important part of it."

There is a fairy temple halfway up the mountain, and the fairy goddess is enshrined on the divine platform. It is said that the fairy lady is specially designed for women and children to treat diseases and ensure safety, so the villagers from the four towns and Balings came here to ask for signs and ask for medicine, and the incense was very popular. The temple was originally built on the top of Xianyu Ridge. In 1833 AD, because most of the worshipers were women and children, considering that they were too difficult to climb the mountain, it was rebuilt on the mountainside. The temple is facing southwest, with two halls in front and back. On the wall of the house on the left, there are 19 square meters of bluestone steles inlaid, which describes the reconstruction and expansion of the Fairy Temple."
